answer the following prompt in a 5-7 sentence paragraph:  
  
How was the Cold War waged in practice? How did the practice of waging the Cold War differ from the ideological rhetoric about the Cold War?  
  
  
The Cold War was waged through various tactics, including military alliances, proxy wars, espionage, propaganda, and economic competition. USA and the USSR sought to expand their spheres of influence, with the US supporting capitalist democracies and the Soviet Union promoting communist governments. However, despite the ideological rhetoric about the need to defend democracy or protect workers' rights, waging the Cold War often involved actions that contradicted these values. For example, the US supported authoritarian regimes in the name of anti-communism, while the Soviet Union brutally repressed dissent and invaded neighboring countries. Furthermore, both sides engaged in a nuclear arms race that posed an existential threat to humanity, despite their rhetoric about the need for peace. Ultimately, the Cold War was waged through ideology and power politics, with each side pursuing its national interests while portraying its actions as necessary for the greater good.
