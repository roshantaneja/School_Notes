	HURRAY, I HAVE THREE SOURCES! WHAT DO I DO NOW? 

If you finish finding three good primary sources during class, you can start working with your primary sources by reading them carefully and starting your Research Assignment 4 Analyzing Primary Sources assignment. You can find this on Schoology under the Research Project folder.


**Follow the instructions to organize your pre-writing and analysis of primary sources. 

  

Source 1:  Paula Ancona, Looking for a Job? Use your computer, Tuesday, December 13th, 1994

Context: List several facts about the source that you’d want to include in your writing -- what IS the source? who produced it? what was happening at the time? what’s the purpose of the source? etc.

  
  
  

Main Ideas. Explain in your own words some of the main ideas of the source. Explain in 1-2 sentences how it answers your research question. 

  
  
  

Powerful Language + IN-TEXT CITATIONS. Drop in any direct quotes that you might want to include in your paper. It’s probably best to include too much, rather than too little, at this point. Put quotation marks around the quotes, and include the in-text citations. 

  
  
  

  

Source 2:  Author, Title, Date.
