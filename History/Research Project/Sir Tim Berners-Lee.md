Welcome to the first phase of the sophomore research paper! Through a series of research assignments this year, you will work closely with your teacher to produce a scholarly research paper of 5-7 pages. You will practice consulting and interpreting a variety of types of primary and secondary sources, and you will also practice using MLA 9 citations correctly. 

Put the name of the person you want to research in the box. Write a sentence or two about why this person is interesting to you.

Now, read and take notes about your person! Focus on the parts of their life that you find most interesting. You do not need to write down everything, but you should start to capture a clear timeline of their life and a substantial number of specific historical details that you may want to use later. Online sources rarely have page numbers, but if yours does, write down the page numbers for future in-text citations.

Narrowing Your Topic:

List 2-3 things about your person that you find especially intriguing and that you would like to learn more about. 

  

1.  Educated at "The queens college, Oxford"

  

2.   Wrote the whole program at CERN on NeXTSTEP, and created the first HTTPd protocol

  

3.  Was knighted by queen Elizabeth for "inventing the World Wide Web, the first web browser, and the fundamental protocols and algorithms allowing the Web to scale"

Notes from Wikipedia Article: (PUT YOUR IN-TEXT CITATION HERE) (“Jackie Robinson”)

Now, go to the Wikipedia article that you have open. Try to find at least one section (perhaps 1-3 paragraphs) that give more, or new details, about one of the topics you have listed above.

Take some additional notes to record these facts. Focus on getting new, specific historical evidence into your notes -- dates, events, important people, organizations, accomplishments, and so on.

Step 4: Develop an Angle and Research Questions (Complete for HW) 

Now, it’s time to narrow down your focus and develop a research question to guide your project. 

  

Some tips for writing a sound question: 

-   Your research question should begin with how or why. 
    
-   Your research question should be specific, not broad or vague.  
    
-   Your research question should ask for an evidence-based historical argument, not an opinion. 
    
-   You should be able to explain why your question is historically significant.
    

  

 Here are some examples of approved research questions from previous years:

-   Why did George Washington appoint Hamilton as the First Treasury Secretary?
    
-   How did Andrew Carnegie's experiences as a railroad employee pave the way for his  later success as an industrialist?
    
-   How did John Brown organize the raid on Harpers Ferry in 1859?
    
-   How did Louise Brooks personify the flapper feminism of the 1920s?
    
-   How did Margaret Sanger work with black leaders and institutions to advance the cause of birth control?
    
-   How did Josephine Baker’s move to France in 1925 transform her career?
    
-   Why did Edward Teller become known as “the father of the hydrogen bomb”?
    
-   Why did Hans Ziegler advocate for the use of solar cells in satellites?
    

  

Read back over your notes, and think about what you want to research more deeply. What lingering questions do you have? What are you curious about? 

  

Then, come up with two possible research questions that start with how or why. After you submit this assignment, I will help you fine-tune the language and decide on one final research question.
