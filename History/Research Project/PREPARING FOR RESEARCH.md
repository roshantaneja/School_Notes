## Research Question


| Type your approved research question in this box.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| In 1994, Berners-Lee founded the W3C at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It comprised various companies that were willing to create standards and recommendations to improve the quality of the Web. Berners-Lee made his idea available freely, with no patent and no royalties due. Why would TBL have founded the web on the ideas of royalty-free technology, and how would this effect the growth of the internet in decades to come? |

| Think about what you’ve learned so far in your Research 1 and Research 2 assignments. What are some topics related to your research that you would like to find out more about? |
| Ronald Reagan had cancer surgery around the time of the Iran Contra Scandal. Later he claimed he couldn’t remember the orders he gave at the time.                              |
| What are some very specific people, places, events, organizations, or dates that you think might help you locate an article that will help you?                                 |

## IN THE LIBRARY


There are four steps to this assignment (the same steps as your book assignment): 
Step 1: Choose a Journal Article Source
Step 2: Add Your Journal Article Source to Noodle Tools 
Step 3: Read and Take Notes 
Step 4: Write about Your Evidence   

________________


## STEP 1: CHOOSE A JOURNAL ARTICLE 


Journal articles are written by scholars who are experts in their field of research. They are a high-quality source of information because they are authored by experts and reviewed by other scholars before publication. (This is what we mean by a “peer-reviewed” source.) Your task is to find ONE good article that helps you answer your research question. 


Unlike books and general reference sources, academic journal articles tend to be written on very specific topics. Finding good journal articles often depends on using the right search terms. If your searches are unsuccessful, try different (more specific) search terms. 


We will use the Discovery One Search box on the Lucas Library front page to begin searching for journal articles. Follow the librarians’ instructions to limit your search to “Academic Journals”. 




Choosing a Good Article
Think carefully about which article will be helpful for your particular research focus. It’s a good idea to check in with your teacher or a librarian to double-check that the article will work well for you. 
 
* REMINDER: Use quotation marks around words that should be searched as a single unit (such as “Al Capone”). 
* Don’t just grab the first article that comes up! Think about your research question and what will help you answer it. 
* You might skim the first and last paragraphs of an article to get a sense for what it is about. You can also skim the topic sentences of each paragraph as a guide to the topics and arguments of the article. 
* In most cases, book reviews don’t count as journal articles. If a source is 3 pages or fewer and is labeled Review or Book Review in the database, it is a book review. Look for another source.
* If you’re not finding what you’re looking for, try more specific search terms. 
* Ask for help if you’re spinning your wheels! This kind of searching can be hard. 






________________


## STEP 2: ADD YOUR SOURCE TO NOODLE TOOLS.
Open your Noodle Tools project in a separate tab. In most cases, you should be able to export your citation directly from the article database to your Noodle Tools project. 


If you do need to enter the citation yourself, you should click on “+ New Source.” Then select “Database” and “Journal,” and enter the fields required. 


  

________________


## STEP 3: TAKE NOTES ON YOUR JOURNAL ARTICLE. 


Once you have selected an article, you’ll need to read and take notes, just as you did with your book source. 


TIPS: 
* You likely will not use the whole article! There may be a section of just a few pages that are very targeted at your question, and the rest of the article may be less relevant. 
* Focus on the information that goes straight to the heart of your research question. You should be looking for new facts and evidence, rather than repeating things you’ve already learned. 
* If you are taking notes, remember to include an in-text citation AND page number for EVERY fact you write down. This will save you from having to go back and re-do this step later. 


Journal Article Notes:
Write your notes here. Include your in-text citations with page numbers.

Direct Section: 
>With the development of the IoT(Internet of Things) platform, where each platform has its own mechanism, without interaction with other platforms, we will take a step backwards compared to the initial idea that Tim Berners-Lee had when designing the Web. The problem of the development of royalty-free and platform-independent standards has been discovered and there are currently working groups under the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) that deal with the standardization and development of the WoT(Web of Things) API since 2015 (White Paper for the Web of Things, 2016)


________________


## STEP 4: WRITE ABOUT YOUR JOURNAL ARTICLE. 


Now that you have collected a lot of facts, start to write about your research question in 1-2 typed pages (12 point font, double-spaced). You should write about some of the most interesting, relevant evidence that you discovered in your book. 


Please write in complete sentences and paragraphs. At this stage, it is fine if your information is presented in “chunks” that are not yet fully connected into an argument -- you may not have a topic sentence, but you should at least group facts together into rough paragraphs. 


**EVERY FACT, STATISTIC, or IDEA from a source MUST be followed by an accurate in-text citation. Even when you are summarizing or paraphrasing in your own words, you MUST include an in-text citation. Leaving out the citation is a form of plagiarism.**




## TWO TIPS FOR SUCCESS: 


* Avoid writing general “background information” or information that is peripheral to your research question. Instead, write about specific facts that go to the heart of your research question.


* Use primarily your own words; while a quote fragment may be appropriate now and then, you should relate the information in your own language as much as possible.
