Welcome to the first phase of the sophomore research paper! Through a series of research assignments this year, you will work closely with your teacher to produce a scholarly research paper of 5-7 pages. You will practice consulting and interpreting a variety of types of primary and secondary sources, and you will also practice using MLA 9 citations correctly. 

  

Put the name of the person you want to research in the box. Write a sentence or two about why this person is interesting to you.

Step 1: Organize Your NoodleTools (In Class) 

  

One of the most important steps in a research project is keeping track of your sources. We will begin our process by setting up a project in Noodle Tools to help you with managing your source citations. For this project, we will use the MLA 9 style guide. 

  

Go to the Lucas Library webpage, [Lucas Library Homepage](https://lucaslibrary.shschools.org/), and open the NoodleTools link (see image below). Please be sure that you’re logged in to your SH Google account, which lets you login to Noodletools (and many of our other databases) via Google– no username-password required! Follow the librarians’ instructions to set up your project.

Step 2: Find and Cite Two Starter Sources (In Class) 

  

When you begin a research process, it is helpful to start with general reference sources that are meant to introduce the reader to new topics. We will use them to gather preliminary facts about your topic, create MLA citations in Noodletools, and to collect terms to narrow your search. 

  

Source 1: Discovery One Search 

Discovery One Search is a portal on the [library website](https://lucaslibrary.shschools.org/) that searches across many kinds of online research sources. For today, we will use it to locate a general reference source -- a peer-reviewed introduction to a topic. 

  

Follow our librarians’ instructions to: 

-   Use Discovery One Search to find a Research Starter article on your person. [NOTE: For a few of your topics, you may need to use a slightly different type of starter source. Your teacher will consult with you if that is the case.] 
    
-   Import your Research Starter citation into your NoodleTools project. 
    

  

Source 2: Wikipedia 

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/) can also be a good starting place. Earlier this year, you learned that Wikipedia pages are trustworthy because they must: 

-   Meet standards of notability
    
-   Be written from a neutral point of view
    
-   Include only claims that are verifiable. Sources for claims must be cited in text at the end of the sentence and hyperlinked in a reference list below the article.

                                             https://en.wikipedia.org/

  
  
  

Follow our librarians’ instructions to: 

-   Find the Wikipedia article on your person. 
    
-   Enter your Wikipedia citation into your NoodleTools project.

Finally, create your Works Cited page! You can do this easily by exporting your sources from NoodleTools. Copy and paste your Works Cited entries into the [final page of this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zEAQLq6V5sFIRSJSMlaxlVFu0L7pPRXlfP3bqQJV3S8/edit#bookmark=id.mdqns59tas8x). ![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/XgYvpkXHn4NPLv_vz_u3uXadhRNRKuEs91jHPRQO_c6ir6TgzZMSZqZ9Kub44j3YAN0_Jf0sgp4UCKJhTu8vUN_VNwxkrlivkF82A3QnYLE384t2B35tcDLbMDn6C3RoEU4IL6goRxJUzlqwYpNSfsk)

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

Step 3: Take Research Notes (Begin In Class, Complete for HW) 

If you would like to see a model of strong research notes vs. not sufficient research notes, you can check that out here: [Models of Research Notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i9UOaxbd6wT2jjSGUWqpmPtdlOOMnE6_xrXcD_JUmQo/edit?usp=sharing).

Notes from Research Starter Source: (PUT YOUR IN-TEXT CITATION HERE) (Finkleman)


Now, read and take notes about your person! Focus on the parts of their life that you find most interesting. You do not need to write down everything, but you should start to capture a clear timeline of their life and a substantial number of specific historical details that you may want to use later. Online sources rarely have page numbers, but if yours does, write down the page numbers for future in-text citations.

Narrowing Your Topic:

List 2-3 things about your person that you find especially intriguing and that you would like to learn more about. 

  

1.  Educated at "The queens college, Oxford"

  

2.   

  

3. 

  

  
  

Notes from Wikipedia Article: (PUT YOUR IN-TEXT CITATION HERE) (“Jackie Robinson”)

Now, go to the Wikipedia article that you have open. Try to find at least one section (perhaps 1-3 paragraphs) that give more, or new details, about one of the topics you have listed above. 

  

Take some additional notes to record these facts. Focus on getting new, specific historical evidence into your notes -- dates, events, important people, organizations, accomplishments, and so on. 

  

  

  

  

Step 4: Develop an Angle and Research Questions (Complete for HW) 

Now, it’s time to narrow down your focus and develop a research question to guide your project. 

  

Some tips for writing a sound question: 

-   Your research question should begin with how or why. 
    
-   Your research question should be specific, not broad or vague.  
    
-   Your research question should ask for an evidence-based historical argument, not an opinion. 
    
-   You should be able to explain why your question is historically significant.
    

  

 Here are some examples of approved research questions from previous years:

-   Why did George Washington appoint Hamilton as the First Treasury Secretary?
    
-   How did Andrew Carnegie's experiences as a railroad employee pave the way for his  later success as an industrialist?
    
-   How did John Brown organize the raid on Harpers Ferry in 1859?
    
-   How did Louise Brooks personify the flapper feminism of the 1920s?
    
-   How did Margaret Sanger work with black leaders and institutions to advance the cause of birth control?
    
-   How did Josephine Baker’s move to France in 1925 transform her career?
    
-   Why did Edward Teller become known as “the father of the hydrogen bomb”?
    
-   Why did Hans Ziegler advocate for the use of solar cells in satellites?
    

  

Read back over your notes, and think about what you want to research more deeply. What lingering questions do you have? What are you curious about? 

  

Then, come up with two possible research questions that start with how or why. After you submit this assignment, I will help you fine-tune the language and decide on one final research question. 

  
  

Question Option 1 

  
  

Question Option 2
