How does a warmonger, tactless and so ruthless Become a figurehead, influential and notorious? The mastermind of realpolitik, they call him Kissinger Started off as an immigrant, ambitious and a schemer

In West Germany, born and raised, a troubled youth he had Came to America to build a legacy so grand He joined the Nixon administration, seeking power's sweet embrace Henry Kissinger, the man with a smile on his face

He said, "I'll be your Secretary, your Secretary of State I'll navigate the globe and dictate our nation's fate From Vietnam to Chile, I'll meddle in affairs Cause chaos and destruction, showing no one cares"

The Cold War was his playground, a game of power and might Back-channel diplomacy, always out of sight He brokered deals in secret, behind closed doors he'd roam But the victims of his policies would never find a home

Oh, Henry Kissinger, you're no founding father Your realpolitik just caused disaster after disaster You may have won a Nobel Prize, but history won't forget The millions who suffered under your geopolitical mindset

You paved the way for dictators, supported coups and wars From East Timor to Cambodia, the body count soars But you dined with the elite, a member of the club While innocent lives were lost, buried under the rub

So raise a glass to Kissinger, the architect of strife A legacy of bloodshed, a never-ending fight But let us not forget, as we sing this parody song That power unchecked can do so much wrong
