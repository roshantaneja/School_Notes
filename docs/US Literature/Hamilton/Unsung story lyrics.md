# Henry Kissinger

How does a warmonger, tactless and so ruthless
Become a figurehead, influential and notorious?
The mastermind of realpolitik, they call him Kissinger 
Started off as an immigrant, ambitious and a schemer

'Realpolitik' founding father without morals,
do strange cases, by finding spaces
destroying races
leaving no traces
Henry Kissinger, the man with so many different faces

He said, "I'll be your Secretary, your Secretary of State
I'll navigate the globe and dictate our nation's fate
From Vietnam to Chile, I'll meddle in affairs 
Cause chaos and destruction, showing no one cares"

In West Germany, born and raised, a troubled youth he had
Came to America to build, built a legacy so grand 
He joined the Nixon administration, seeking power's sweet embrace
Henry Kissinger, the man with a smile on his face

Well, the Cold War was his playground, a game of power and might
Back-channel diplomacy, always out of sight, shrouded by night
Behind closed doors, secret deals were made
While innocent lives crumbled, left betrayed
What's his name man?

Oh, Henry Kissinger
Your name is Henry Kissinger
You may have won a Nobel Prize, but history won't forget
Your life debt, life debt

You paved the way for dictators, supported coups and wars
From East Timor to Cambodia, the body count soars 
But you dined with the elite, a member of the club 

While innocent lives were lost, shoved under the rug

So raise a glass to Kissinger, the architect of strife
A legacy of bloodshed, a never-ending fight
But let us not forget, as we sing this parody song

That power unchecked can do so much wrong
  
In the midst of the chaos, his power did increase  
But scandals and controversies, they never did cease  
From secret bombings in Cambodia, the truth he'd conceal  
His name synonymous with cunning, a master of the deal
He'd spin a web of diplomacy, an intricate charade  
A Nobel Peace Prize winner, with a darkened accolade  
Behind closed doors, the whispers would grow  
As critics questioned his actions, the seeds of doubt they'd sow
