## L4.1 Student Sheet
*Lesson 4.1: What are greenhouse gas emissions and how does the amount relate to car fuel type?*

### INTRODUCTION:

1.  Open up the [IMT](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oOD0KgRfL3Oq5ahvuiWuf3WLjWakWEk3/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=101610972662753304413&rtpof=true&sd=true) for this unit, make a copy and fill in the question and wondering for lesson 1

### PREVIEW:

1.  Watch the entire video on [New York Cities-Greenhouse Gas Emissions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqSIplGXOA&t=16s) (3:12).
    

1.  What do you think is going on here?
    

2.  What does one blue sphere represent?
    

3.  What is inaccurate about this representation?
    

4.  How do you think weather (such as wind or rain) would affect this simulation?
    

B. Now open the [Carbon Calculator:](http://www.parkcitygreen.org/Calculators/Kids-Calculator.aspx)

1.  What was your score?
    

2.  How does your score compare to other students?
    

3.  What do you feel about your score?
    

4.  Do you want to make your score higher, how might you do this?

### INVESTIGATION: 

1.  Examine [Figure ES-14: US Greenhouse Gas Emissions Allocated to Economic Sectors](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16XmtWsurB75BmQUjs69xTfVfptNDgF-i6MG0VTi8i84/edit?usp=sharing).
