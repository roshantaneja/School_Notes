How can we measure the energy released in a chemical reaction? 

  

Introduction: 

Using common chemistry lab techniques, we can measure the amount of energy released from a chemical reaction by placing a beaker of water above the reaction and recording the change in temperature before and after. If we assume that all of the energy from the reaction goes into the water, then the energy released from the reaction is approximately equal to the energy absorbed by the water. This is due to the law of conservation of energy. We will record the mass of the water and the temperature before and after the reaction to determine the total energy absorbed. This method of determining the amount of energy released from a reaction is known as calorimetry. It’s also the same process that food scientists use to determine the amount of energy in calories in the foods you eat.  

  

When we know the mass, specific heat (how well something holds heat), and change of temperature of the system or the surroundings, then we can calculate the energy transferred using the equation: 

q = mcsΔT    

q = heat in joules

m = mass in g

cs = the specific heat capacity

ΔT = the change in temperature in oC  

  

Because the object and surroundings are in contact, the energy transferred between the object and surroundings is equal and is measured using the equation –q = +q.  

The –q represents the releasing energy, which indicates an exothermic process (Look at the picture below).  An exothermic process is where an object loses energy to the surroundings and the surroundings gain the same amount of energy according to the law of conservation of energy.   

  

The +q represents gaining energy, which indicates an endothermic process (Look at the picture object gains the same amount of energy according to the law of conservation of energy.   

  
  
  
  
  
  
  

The amount of energy transferred from an object to the surrounding or from the surrounding to an object is equal in magnitude due to the law of conservation of energy, but not in sign. 

  

Practice Problems for q = mcsΔT

  

1.  How much energy is needed to change the temperature of 50.0 g of H2O by 150C? 
    

  
  
  
  
  

2.  How many grams of water can be heated from 20.0oC to 75.0oC using 12500.0 Joules?
    

  
  
  
  
  

3.  What is the final temperature after 840 Joules is absorbed by 10.0g of water at 25.0oC?
    

  
  
  
  
  

4.  What is the specific heat of aluminium if the temperature of a 28.4 g sample of aluminum in increased by 8.10C, when 207J of heat is added? 
    

  
  
  
  

5.  What is the specific heat of silicon if the temperature of a 4.11 g sample of silicon is increased by 3.80C when 11.1 J of heat is added? 
    

  
  

6.  How much heat must be added to an 8.21g sample of gold to increase it’s temperature by 6.20C? The specific heat of gold is 0.13 j/g 0C
    

  
  
  
  

### NEXT STEPS:

1.  Reflect on today’s question: Why does burning one mole of gasoline result in more energy than burning one mole of hydrogen?
    
2.  Open up the IMT for this unit, complete all boxes for lesson 9
    
3.  Make sure all parts of the L4.9 student sheet are complete & complete the check for understanding on schoology.
