### APPLYING RESULTS TO ENGINE MODEL 

5.  How would you use this information to revise our working model to explain how fuel makes an engine work (and therefore a car move)? Keep in mind that ethanol is added to gasoline. Consider...
    

1.  Which stroke(s) involve the process of evaporation?
    

  

2.  State evidence from your everyday experiences that gasoline evaporates as well as the ethanol additives.
    

  
  
  

3.  Which stroke(s) involve combustion?
    

  

4.  In our model so far, how does fuel make an engine work (and therefore a car move)?

Procedure

1.  Set up a ring stand with three clamps, and attach one thermometer to each of the clamps.
    
2.  Obtain approximately 500 mL of water from the white carboy container at the sink, if your instructor has not done this for you.
    
3.  Label your beakers: #1 ,#2, #3, if not done so for you.
    
4.  Fill 3-150 mL beakers with 50 mL of water each using a graduated cylinder. Record the exact volume of water used for each in the data table.
    
5.  Place the beaker so that the thermometer is immersed in the water but not touching the bottom or the sides of the beakers.
    
6.  Record the initial temperature of the water in each of the beakers in the data table.
    
7.  Using the scale and a weighing boat, measure approximately 4.0 g of ammonium nitrate.  Record your exact mass in the data table. 
    
8.  Using the scale and a weighing boat, measure approximately 4.0 g of calcium chloride.  Record your exact mass in the data table.
    
9.  Simultaneously, add the 4.0 g of ammonium nitrate to one beaker, and add 4.0 g of calcium chloride to the second beaker, and leave the third beaker without any chemical added.
    
10.  Immediately start the stop watches and stir the beakers with a stirring rod continuously. 
    
11.  Record the temperature every minute for a total of 10 minutes in the data table.
    
12.  Clean by emptying the solutions into the waste beakers in the fume hood. Rinse the beakers, stirring rods, and thermometers with water. 
    
13.  Return everything as it was before beginning the experiment including placing materials especially the chemicals on the red tray.

#### RESULTS/ANALYSIS

7.  For each substance, look at the data table and record the highest temperature and lowest temperature.

| Substances       | Highest temperature (ºC) | Lowest temperature(ºC) |
| ---------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Ammonium Nitrate | 14.8                     | 12.6                   |
| Calcium Chloride | 24.7                     | 23.7                   |

8. 
	a)  An exothermic process or reaction releases energy. Which solution released heat or was “exothermic”?
	
    b) An endothermic process or reaction requires energy. Which solution required heat or was “endothermic”?

9. Aqueous (aq) is used by scientists to indicate that a solid is dissolved in water. Equations can be used to describe the process of dissolving each of these compounds.  Modify the equations so that heat is shown as part of the equation. Do this by adding heat (+ heat) to either the reactant or product side of the equation.  
    
	*Dissolving NH4NO3 in H2O:*
		NH4NO3 (s) → NH4NO3 (aq) 
	*Dissolving CaCl2 in H2O:*
		CaCl2 (s) → CaCl2 (aq)

  
  

10.  These processes are used in our lives as hot packs and cold packs.  
    

1.  Which chemical would you use in a cold pack?  Why?
    

  
  

2.  Which chemical would you use in a hot pack?  Why?
    

  
  

11.  This investigation helped us define the flow of energy of a system. Do you think either of these processes could be used as energy for moving a car? Explain your answer.
    

  
  
  

12.  If we are looking to find alternative fuel sources, what are some criteria they should meet to power the engines we currently use?
    

  
  

### NEXT STEPS:
