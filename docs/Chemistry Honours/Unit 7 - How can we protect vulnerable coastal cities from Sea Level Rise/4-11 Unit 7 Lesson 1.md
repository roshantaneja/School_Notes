**Lesson 1:  What is sea level rise and what is the impact of sea levels rising?

  

# NOTICING AND WONDERING: 

1.  Record what you notice and wonder while we watch as a class the video,[Untold Stories of Climate Change Loss and Damage: Sierra Leone](https://youtu.be/qWx3-9TREDU) (2:16) in the chart below.
    

| Noticing                                                                                     | Wondering                                                                                                                                      |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| The video discusses the impacts of climate change on lesser developed countries in the world | How are governments planning to take leadership/responsibility for their actions and work to help repair the damage caused by their emissions? | 

2.  Share insights from #1 as a class.  What do we think?

* coastal communities like the pacific islands may be effected by climate change as a whole.
* underdeveloped countries are effected more disproportionately by climate change in comparison to many of the culprits of climate change.
* Natural disasters are causing displacement and deaths
* what do countries like America or England decide how to repair the damage caused?
* 

  

3.  Record what you notice and wonder while we watch as a class the video, [Sea Level Rise and the California Coast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZTFqibxGps), in the chart below. 
    

| Noticing                                                                                                         | Wondering                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| The way we manage our coasts is not set up for posterity, due to public dissent towards loss of private property | How will the Californian government decide to move residents from their coastlines without infringing on their rights? Is it safe to continue living near the beach even today? | 

4.  Share insights from #2 as a class.  What do we think as a class?

* 


5.  Create investigation working groups to explore the impact of climate change in three additional global locations. 
	1. Record what each group member noticed and wondered.  
	2. In each case, record the location investigated and the source used. 
	3. Visit three location studies -two locations from the list and one other location from your own research on an area of your interest.

6.  Come to consensus in your group about what you think is happening to all the people in the videos or articles. 
    


7.  Why are these people often called Climate migrants or climate refugees? 
    

  
  
  

8.  MAP LOCATIONS OF PEOPLE DISPLACED BY CLIMATE CHANGE
	1. Label Antarctica, Arctic circle, and Greenland on the map.
	2. Record the locations of the groups of people you saw in the videos or read about in articles on the map below. 
	3. What is similar about their location on the map?
    

  

9.  ANALYZING SEA LEVELS: FROM [JPL/NASA](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/edu/pdfs/sealevel_worksheet.pdf):  Use the satellite data graphs at [https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/sea-level/](https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/sea-level/) to answer the questions below. (Note: To obtain exact data points, place your mouse on the section of the graph you would like to examine.)
    

1.  What is the source of the data for each graph? 
    

  

2.  Which years are covered by each graph?
    

  

3.  Is one graph a better representation of global sea levels than the other? Why or why not?
    

  

4.  By approximately how many millimeters did sea level rise between: 
    

1.  1910 and 1930? __________
    
2.  1930 and 1950?  _________
    

5.  What is the approximate average rate of increase in sea level rise between 1970 and 2000?   ________________
    
6.  By how many millimeters did the sea level rise between the first measurement obtained in January 1993 and the first measurement obtained in January 2013?
    

  

7.  What is the approximate rate of sea level rise between January 1993 and the present? 
    

  

10.  What is changing when the sea levels rise? 
    

  

11.  What are we measuring?
    

  

12.  How do the sea levels rise?  Watch [video](https://youtu.be/9JuKqkZVgTU) and answer the question.
    

  
  
  

13.  Draw a model of sea level rise.
    

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

14.  Using the thermal volume expansion equation ΔV = βV0ΔT, where:

$$

-   ΔV = the change in volume
    
-   β is the thermal volume expansion coefficient → @ 20oC water is 2.10 x 10-4 oC-1
    
-   V0 is initial volume → current volume of the pacific ocean is 660,000,000 km3
    
-   ΔT = change in temperature → the predicted change in temperature in the year 2100 is between 1-4 oC 
    

  

Use this equation to find the change in the pacific ocean’s volume by the year 2100 if the change in temperature was 1oC.  Also, find the change in volume if the temperature change was 4 oC.  

  
  

# If the area of the ocean is 361,740,000 km2, how much would the ocean rise in centimeters if the temperature rose by 1oC?

  
  

How much would the ocean rise in centimeters if the temperature rose by 4oC?

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

NEXT STEPS:

1.  Reflect on today’s question: What is sea level rise and what is the impact of sea levels rising?
    
2.  Open up the IMT for this unit, complete all boxes for lesson 1
    
3.  Make sure all parts of the L7.1 student sheet are complete & complete the edpuzzle on Schoology.**
