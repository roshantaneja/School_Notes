*Lesson 7.6:  What is happening to the atmosphere as heat is added?

1.  Let’s review lesson L 7.4 with a calorimetry problem. Remember q = mC∆T. How much energy, in Joules, would it take to heat 250 mL of water (specific heat water 4.184 J/g°C) from 20°C to 37°C? How much energy in calories (specific heat water 1.00 cal/g°C)

$q_{J} = 250g * 4.184 * 17 = 17782 J$

$q_c = 4250 C$
  

2.  Recalling our previous lesson, [‘Global Warming or None Like it Hot!](https://youtu.be/OqVyRa1iuMc)’ 
    1.  What does this representation do well? 
    2.  Would ice help with global warming?
    3.  What did we learn last class about sea level rise? Review the IMT for Lesson 5.
    

  
  

Investigating Gases

Gasses are important to the atmosphere and oceans.  The behavior of gasses follows predictive patterns called ‘gas laws’. Understanding the gas laws is fundamental to understanding the gas exchange between the ocean and the atmosphere. In this activity, you are going to do a series of four investigations to see the relationship between four variables that affect gasses: pressure, temperature, volume, and the number of particles.

  

Let’s define these variables as they relate to gasses:

  

Pressure, P: The rapid motion and collisions of molecules with the walls of the container cause pressure (force on a unit area). The pressure is proportional to the number of molecular collisions and the force of the collisions in a particular area. The more collisions of gas molecules with the walls, the higher the pressure.  

  

Temperature, T: The temperature of a gas is a measure of the average translational kinetic energy of the molecules. In a hot gas, the molecules move faster than in a cold gas; the mass remains the same, but the kinetic energy, and hence the temperature, is greater because of the increased velocity of the molecules.  

  

Volume, V: Gasses do not have a fixed volume where the volume depends on the container holding the gas.  For our purposes, volume refers to the space the collective gas particles occupy and not the space occupied by a single gas particle.  Since gas particles are so small, their volumes are negligible.  But the space occupied by the gas particles as a collective is considered the volume, which equates to the volume of the container holding the gas.  

  

Number of particles, n: The number of particles present impacts the behavior of gasses. The number of particles is the number of moles of a substance.  Remember that 1 mole = 6.02 x 1023 count.

Investigation 1: Boyle's Law

1.  Grab your syringe and remove the plunger so the plunger and plastic barrel of the syringe are separated.
    
2.  Take 1 small marshmallow and place it into the barrel of the syringe.  
    
3.  Insert the plunger and push the plunger down to the point where the plunger is slightly touching the marshmallow. 
    

4.  Twist the black cap onto the hub and secure it tightly.
    
5.  Once the cap is secure, pull up on the plunger while holding the barrel in place.  Make the observations in the table below.
    
6.  Unscrew and remove the cap. This allows atmospheric gasses to come into equilibrium with the gas inside the syringe.  
    
7.  Move the plunger up to a point so there is a couple of centimeters above the marshmallow.
    
8.  Twist cap onto the hub and secure tightly again.
    
9.  Once the cap is secure, push down on the plunger while holding the barrel in place. Make observations in the table below.
    
10.  Complete the questions in the data table below.
