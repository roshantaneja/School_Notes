## L5.1 Student Sheet

*Lesson 5.1: What should we do at the end of the life of a smartphone? Reuse? Recycle? Dispose of?

  

### INTRODUCTION:

Open up the [IMT for this unit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/127j--zXw26zFZ2Y4GYNWMNp93Gyq57Ew/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=111581771020805598569&rtpof=true&sd=true), make a copy and fill in the question and wondering for lesson 1

  

### EXPLORATION:

As a team, look/read at EPA [“The Life Cycle of a Cell Phone”](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ptv7uSlLCEgmaHbLrHfHeVo0yAhsDjT_/view?usp=sharing) poster. Next, complete table A below

  

TABLE A:  KWL “Life Cycle of the Cell Phone” *List at least 5 bullets in each category below.

| KNOW: What do you know about the life cycle of a cell phone? | WANT TO KNOW: What do you want to know about the life of a cell phone?   | LEARNED: What have you learned about the life of a cell phone? |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |

INVESTIGATION: Research the pros and cons of Reusing, Recycling, and Disposing of Smartphones. Next, complete Table B below

  

TABLE B:  REUSE, RECYCLE or DISPOSE


| REUSE: What are the pros and cons of reusing the smartphone?          | RECYCLE: What are the pros and cons of recycling the smartphone?      | DISPOSE: What are the pros and cons of disposing of the smartphone? |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| PROS: Schools, underprivileged members of society can now have phones | PROS: Rechargable batteries can be recycled and reused in new phones. |                                                                     |

### SHARING: 

Each pair will place at least one post-it of your research on our combined class jamboard (find link on Schoology) for each page (i-vii). Jamboard pages include: LEARNED, Reusing Pros & Cons, Recycling Pros & Cons, Disposing Pros & Cons. We will review this information as a class. 

  

### CER:

Decide how you will end the life of your smartphone. You can choose either reusing, recycling or disposing of your smartphone. Fill out a [CER template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J7uRPxNlGvLRyYjwHkP3ymPu9bcv3ILyDhXHfMuLDh0/edit?usp=sharing) (not a paragraph, just a claim and three evidence and reasoning statements with citation) based on your decision.  Use your team research and the class jamboard to help with your thinking. CER template is on the following page
