### PURPOSE:  Discover how to take a smartphone apart.In the process of taking the phone apart.

#### Part 1. Reviewing the Chemistry of Smartphones
Review the Chemistry of the Smartphone Infographic we have used so far in class.  
List the four major components of the smartphone.



Use the picture from Cellphone Chemistry Infographic to discover more about the organization of parts inside a smartphone before you take one apart yourself. 
List the name of each layer and the function of that part of the smartphone.

| Name    | Function |
| ------- | -------- |
| Layer 1 |          |
| Layer 2 |          |
| Layer 3 |          |
| Layer 4 |          |
| Layer 5 |          |
| Layer 6 |          |


#### Part 2. Smartphone Disassembly Research
Each pair of students will be given a smartphone. Research the phone you have been given from your teacher. You may not be able to identify the model or year of the phone. You should be able to identify the manufacturer of the smartphone. Record information below.

Smartphone Name/Brand/Model:  
Year (If possible):
