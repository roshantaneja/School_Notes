The Internet and the World Wide Web have revolutionized how we live, work, and communicate, and their impact on society and commerce cannot be overstated. In particular, the web's ability to connect people and information across geographic and cultural boundaries has transformed how we access and share information. Tim Berners-Lee's founding of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and his decision to make the web's technology royalty-free were pivotal in shaping the development of the web as an open, accessible platform for innovation and collaboration. This paper will explore the historical context and significance of Berners-Lee's decision and its ongoing implications for the future of the web and the digital economy. By examining how the web has evolved over the past few decades, this paper will provide insights into the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead as we navigate the digital age's complex and rapidly changing landscape.

The internet started in the late 1960s as a method for government researchers to share information. Computers in the 60s were large and clunky and a nuisance. Before the internet, information could only be shared if one traveled to the computer's location or was documented on a magnetic tape and shipped through the postal system. Another catalyst of the internet was the heating tensions of the cold war. The US Defense Dept. wanted to ensure a method of information dissemination even after a nuclear fallout (Tot, Ivan). Their necessity took the shape of ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network), the network that eventually evolved in infrastructure into the modern-day Internet. January 1st, 1983, is what most consider the creation of the modern internet. Until that point, most computers did not have a standardized method of communication with one another. A new protocol was established, Transfer Control Protocol/Internetwork Protocol (TCP/IP) (Weaving the Web). This allowed different kinds of computers to "talk" with one another, regardless of the network. ARPANET and the Defense Dept. officially sanctioned TCP/IP as standard on Jan 1st, 1983, marking the birth of the "internet." Fast forward about six years, and Berners-Lee comes into the picture. During the time, several other companies were attempting to capitalize on the newly regulated internet. They created private networks similar to television, which required a subscription to join and navigate. This resulted in a risk of proprietary software becoming necessary to navigate the internet. Berners-Lee noticed this risk and decided to take action. He developed a royalty-free network instead. At CERN, he integrated the preexisting TCP/IP and Hypertext technologies and created the first "World Wide Web."  Berners-Lee published the first website, which was self-serving (White Paper for the Web of Things). The website described the world wide web and how to use it and invited collaborators to build on the technology. 

During the creation of the WC3, TBL decided to found a system of governance that relied on open-source development and transparency with its community. Although he founded the WC3 as an initiative attached to CERN, it quickly became an independent organization. Tim Berners-Lee's motivations for making the web's technology royalty-free were shaped by his beliefs and values regarding the web and its potential. As the web inventor, Berners-Lee envisioned a decentralized and open platform accessible to all, regardless of background or economic status. He believed that the web could transform society and democratize access to information and that collaboration and community were essential to realizing this potential. Berners-Lee's decision to forgo patents and royalties reflects his vision for the web's future as an open and collaborative platform for innovation(). He recognized that "patents and royalties could create barriers to entry and limit innovation, particularly for individuals and organizations that lacked the resources to secure and enforce patents"(TBL, Weaving the Web). By making the web's technology royalty-free, Berners-Lee sought to level the playing field and ensure that anyone could participate in the development and evolution of the web. Furthermore, Berners-Lee recognized that the web's success depended on the contributions of a diverse and global community of developers and users. By removing financial incentives and proprietary control, he sought to encourage collaboration and foster a culture of openness and sharing. This decision helped to create a culture of innovation that has enabled the web to evolve rapidly and adapt to changing technologies and user needs. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has played a crucial role in developing standards and recommendations for the web, helping to ensure interoperability and compatibility across different devices and platforms(White Paper for the Web of Things). The W3C has also been a critical advocate for adopting open and royalty-free technologies, significantly impacting the web's growth over the past several decades.

These technologies enabled the web to evolve rapidly and adapt to changing user needs, creating new business and social interaction opportunities. Royalty-free technology has helped promote innovation and competition, allowing a more comprehensive range of developers and organizations to participate in web development. The use of royalty-free technology has also helped to ensure the accessibility of the web, as it reduces barriers to entry and promotes the development of technologies compatible with a wide range of devices and platforms. This has been essential in enabling the web to reach users in developing countries and other areas with limited access to technology(Tot, Ivan). In addition, the use of royalty-free technology has helped to promote a culture of collaboration and sharing within the web development community (Tim Berners-Lee, Wikipedia). This has led to the creation of numerous open-source projects and initiatives, which have helped to advance the state of the art in web development and promote best practices in the field.

Recent years have seen challenges to using royalty-free technology in web development. One major challenge has been the emergence of proprietary technologies not subject to the same open and collaborative development processes as royalty-free technologies. These proprietary technologies can limit innovation and stifle competition, as they are often controlled by a single company or organization that has the power to dictate how they are used and developed. Another challenge to royalty-free technology is the potential impact of patent trolls, who acquire patents to extract royalties from those who use the technology. This can create barriers to entry and limit innovation, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises that lack the resources to fight patent infringement lawsuits.

	"The implications of these challenges for the future of the web are significant. If proprietary technologies become dominant, the openness and accessibility of the web could be at risk. This could limit the ability of smaller organizations and individuals to participate in web development and could reduce the potential for innovation and competition." (TBL, Weaving the Web)

Similarly, if patent trolls are allowed to continue to extract royalties from web technologies, this could stifle innovation and limit the development of new technologies. It could also lead to increased costs for organizations that use web technologies, as they are forced to pay royalties to multiple patent holders(Halpin, Harry, Patent Pending). To address these challenges, it will be essential to continue promoting royalty-free technologies in web development and to educate users and organizations about the importance of open and collaborative development processes. It may also be necessary to explore alternative patent ownership and enforcement models, such as using patent pools or creating industry-wide standards for patent licensing. By taking these steps, it may be possible to ensure that the web remains an open and accessible platform that benefits all users. These actions are precisely the actions that Berners-Lee took to ensure that the web remained royalty-free and "friendly." Due to his efforts to contain the development of malicious, harmful, or exploitative technologies, TBL has promoted a sense of competition and collaboration that has never been seen in a globally contributed project. Fast-forward almost 40 years since the development of the internet, and it remains open for anyone to use without restrictions.

The growth of the internet has had a significant impact on its users. In 1993, there were only around 130 websites, but by 2000, there were over 10 million(April 2023 Web Server Survey). This growth has given users access to a wealth of information and resources that were previously unavailable.

The growth of the internet has also led to a significant increase in internet-related jobs. Resume databases, software engineers, and website designers became highly sought after, as every company needed an online presence. By 2000, 2.5 Million Americans made a living directly from the Internet(Reuters). This growth in internet-related jobs has positively impacted the job market.

The Internet has had a profound impact on businesses. Companies like Google, Yahoo, and AOL were born online, and many traditional businesses now have an online presence. The Internet has also given consumers access to various resources, including the Library of Congress, online journals, and newspapers. 

Many technologies were developed in tandem with the internet. For example, Search Engines like Google, Yahoo, and AskJeeves have become household names, with millions of users accessing the internet through them. These browsers have given users easy access to the internet and have been instrumental in the growth of the web.

The internet has also revolutionized communication. Email servers like Yahoo, Gmail, and Hotmail have made it easy for people to communicate with each other from anywhere in the world. Chat rooms like AIM and Yahoo chats have also given users new ways to communicate with each other. VOIP, or Voice over Internet Protocol, has made long-distance communication cheaper and more accessible. 

By 2000, over 50% of Americans used the internet regularly. Of that 50%, 70% were adolescents between 18 and 29(). The internet was not an invention for the current generation, it was an invention for the future. The largest adopters of the internet in years to come would nt be 

In conclusion, this research paper has examined the significance of Berners-Lee's founding of the W3C and his decision to make the web's technology royalty-free. It has discussed his vision for a decentralized and open web accessible to all and the potential impact of royalties and patents on developing and adopting web technologies. Furthermore, this research has explored how royalty-free technology has influenced the adoption and growth of the web over the past several decades. It has highlighted the role of the W3C in promoting the adoption of open and royalty-free technologies and ensuring interoperability and compatibility across different devices and platforms. However, this research has also identified challenges to royalty-free technology, such as the emergence of proprietary technologies and the potential impact of patent trolls. These challenges have implications for the future of the web, including the openness, accessibility, and innovation potential of the web. Therefore, this research suggests that it is essential to continue to promote the use of royalty-free technologies in the development of the web and explore alternative models for patent ownership and enforcement.Further research is also needed to examine the potential impact of emerging technologies on the future of the web and the role of governments and other stakeholders in promoting an open and accessible web. In conclusion, the web has the potential to be a platform for innovation, collaboration, and growth for everyone. It is essential to ensure that the web remains an open and accessible platform that benefits all users, regardless of their background or resources.
