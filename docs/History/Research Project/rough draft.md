The Internet and the World Wide Web have revolutionized how we live, work, and communicate, and their impact on society and commerce cannot be overstated. In particular, the web's ability to connect people and information across geographic and cultural boundaries has transformed how we access and share information. Tim Berners-Lee's founding of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and his decision to make the web's technology royalty-free were pivotal in shaping the development of the web as an open, accessible platform for innovation and collaboration. This paper will explore the historical context and significance of Berners-Lee's decision and its ongoing implications for the future of the web and the digital economy. By examining how the web has evolved over the past few decades, this paper will provide insights into the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead as we navigate the digital age's complex and rapidly changing landscape.



## II. Historical context

-   Background information on the state of the internet and the web in the early 1990s
    -   The emergence of the World Wide Web and the development of the first web browser
    -   The rapid growth of the internet and the proliferation of proprietary technologies
-   Discussion of the emergence of proprietary technologies and their potential impact on the growth of the web
    -   The potential for proprietary technologies to limit innovation and stifle competition
    -   The potential for proprietary technologies to fragment the web and make it more difficult to access information


The internet started in the late 1960s as a method for government researchers to share information. Computers in the 60s were large and clunky and a nuisance. Before the internet, information could only be shared if one traveled to the computer's location or was documented on a magnetic tape and shipped through the postal system. Another catalyst of the internet was the heating tensions of the cold war. The US Defense Dept. wanted to ensure a method of information dissemination even after a nuclear fallout (Tot, Ivan). Their necessity took the shape of ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network), the network that eventually evolved in infrastructure into the modern-day Internet. January 1st, 1983, is what most consider the creation of the modern internet. Until that point, most computers did not have a standardized method of communication with one another. A new protocol was established, Transfer Control Protocol/Internetwork Protocol (TCP/IP). This allowed different kinds of computers to "talk" with one another, regardless of the network. ARPANET and the Defense Dept. officially sanctioned TCP/IP as standard on Jan 1st, 1983, marking the birth of the "internet."

Fast forward about six years, and Berners-Lee comes into the picture. During the time, several other companies were attempting to capitalize on the newly regulated internet. They created private networks similar to television, which required a subscription to join and navigate. This resulted in a risk of proprietary software becoming necessary to navigate the internet. Berners-Lee noticed this risk and decided to take action. He developed a royalty-free network instead. At CERN, he integrated the preexisting TCP/IP and Hypertext technologies and created the first "World Wide Web."  Berners-Lee published the first website, which was self-serving (White Paper for the Web of Things | WPWT). The website described the world wide web and how to use it and invited collaborators to build on the technology. 

## III. Berners-Lee's motivations for royalty-free technology
 
-   Examination of Berners-Lee's beliefs and values regarding the web and its potential
    -   Berners-Lee's vision for a decentralized and open web that is accessible to all
    -   Berners-Lee's belief in the power of collaboration and the importance of community in the development of the web
-   Discussion of his decision to forgo patents and royalties and how this decision reflects his vision for the web's future
    -   The potential impact of patents and royalties on the development and adoption of web technologies
    -   The potential for patents and royalties to create barriers to entry and limit innovation


During the creation of the WC3, TBL decided to found a system of governance that relied on open-source development and transparency with its community. Although he founded the WC3 as an initiative attached to CERN, it quickly became an independent organization. Tim Berners-Lee's motivations for making the web's technology royalty-free were shaped by his beliefs and values regarding the web and its potential. As the web inventor, Berners-Lee envisioned a decentralized and open platform accessible to all, regardless of background or economic status. He believed that the web could transform society and democratize access to information and that collaboration and community were essential to realizing this potential.

Berners-Lee's decision to forgo patents and royalties reflects his vision for the web's future as an open and collaborative platform for innovation. He recognized that patents and royalties could create barriers to entry and limit innovation, particularly for individuals and organizations that lacked the resources to secure and enforce patents. By making the web's technology royalty-free, Berners-Lee sought to level the playing field and ensure that anyone could participate in the development and evolution of the web.

Furthermore, Berners-Lee recognized that the web's success depended on the contributions of a diverse and global community of developers and users. By removing financial incentives and proprietary control, he sought to encourage collaboration and foster a culture of openness and sharing. This decision helped to create a culture of innovation that has enabled the web to evolve rapidly and adapt to changing technologies and user needs.



## IV. The impact of royalty-free technology on the Web's growth

-   Overview of the W3C's role in developing standards and recommendations for the web
    -   The importance of standards and recommendations for ensuring interoperability and compatibility across different devices and platforms
    -   The role of the W3C in promoting the adoption of open and royalty-free technologies
-   Examination of how royalty-free technology influenced the adoption and growth of the web over the past several decades
    -   The role of royalty-free technology in promoting innovation and competition
    -   The potential impact of royalty-free technology on the accessibility of the web

The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has played a crucial role in developing standards and recommendations for the web, helping to ensure interoperability and compatibility across different devices and platforms. The W3C has also been a critical advocate for adopting open and royalty-free technologies, significantly impacting the web's growth over the past several decades.

Royalty-free technology has helped promote innovation and competition, allowing a more comprehensive range of developers and organizations to participate in web development. This has enabled the web to evolve rapidly and adapt to changing user needs, creating new business and social interaction opportunities.

The use of royalty-free technology has also helped to ensure the accessibility of the web, as it reduces barriers to entry and promotes the development of technologies compatible with a wide range of devices and platforms. This has been particularly important in enabling the web to reach users in developing countries and other areas with limited access to technology.

In addition, the use of royalty-free technology has helped to promote a culture of collaboration and sharing within the web development community. This has led to the creation of numerous open-source projects and initiatives, which have helped to advance the state of the art in web development and promote best practices in the field.

## V. Challenges to royalty-free technology

-   Discussion of recent challenges to royalty-free technology, including the emergence of proprietary technologies and the potential impact of patent trolls
    -   The potential for proprietary technologies to limit innovation and stifle competition
    -   The potential impact of patent trolls on the development and adoption of web technologies
-   Analysis of the implications of these challenges for the future of the web
    -   The potential impact of these challenges on the openness and accessibility of the web
    -   The potential for these challenges to limit innovation and the development of new technologies

Recent years have seen challenges to using royalty-free technology in web development. One major challenge has been the emergence of proprietary technologies not subject to the same open and collaborative development processes as royalty-free technologies. These proprietary technologies can limit innovation and stifle competition, as they are often controlled by a single company or organization that has the power to dictate how they are used and developed.

Another challenge to royalty-free technology is the potential impact of patent trolls, who acquire patents to extract royalties from those who use the technology. This can create barriers to entry and limit innovation, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises that lack the resources to fight patent infringement lawsuits.

	"The implications of these challenges for the future of the web are significant. If proprietary technologies become dominant, the openness and accessibility of the web could be at risk. This could limit the ability of smaller organizations and individuals to participate in web development and could reduce the potential for innovation and competition." (TBL, Weaving the Web)

Similarly, if patent trolls are allowed to continue to extract royalties from web technologies, this could stifle innovation and limit the development of new technologies. It could also lead to increased costs for organizations that use web technologies, as they are forced to pay royalties to multiple patent holders.

To address these challenges, it will be essential to continue promoting royalty-free technologies in web development and to educate users and organizations about the importance of open and collaborative development processes. It may also be necessary to explore alternative models for patent ownership and enforcement, such as using patent pools or creating industry-wide standards for patent licensing. By taking these steps, it may be possible to ensure that the web remains an open and accessible platform that benefits all users.
