### Introduction
The Internet and the World Wide Web have revolutionized how we live, work, and communicate, and their impact on society and commerce cannot be overstated. In particular, the web's ability to connect people and information across geographic and cultural boundaries has transformed how we access and share information. Tim Berners-Lee's founding of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and his decision to make the web's technology royalty-free were pivotal in shaping the development of the web as an open, accessible platform for innovation and collaboration. This paper will explore the historical context and significance of Berners-Lee's decision and its ongoing implications for the future of the web and the digital economy. By examining how the web has evolved over the past few decades, this paper will provide insights into the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead as we navigate the digital age's complex and rapidly changing landscape.

### A Brief History.
The internet started in the late 1960s as a method for government researchers to share information. Computers in the 60s were large and clunky and a nuisance. Before the internet, information could only be shared if one traveled to the computer's location or was documented on a magnetic tape and shipped through the postal system. Another catalyst of the internet was the heating tensions of the cold war. The US Defense Dept. wanted to ensure a method of information dissemination even after a nuclear fallout (Tot, Ivan). Their necessity took the shape of ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network), the network that eventually evolved in infrastructure into the modern-day Internet. January 1st, 1983, is what most consider the creation of the modern internet. Until that point, most computers did not have a standardized method of communication with one another. A new protocol was established, Transfer Control Protocol/Internetwork Protocol (TCP/IP). This allowed different kinds of computers to "talk" with one another, regardless of the network. ARPANET and the Defense Dept. officially sanctioned TCP/IP as standard on Jan 1st, 1983, marking the birth of the "internet."

Fast forward about six years, and Berners-Lee comes into the picture. During the time, several other companies were attempting to capitalize on the newly regulated internet. They created private networks similar to television, which required a subscription to join and navigate. This resulted in a risk of proprietary software becoming necessary to navigate the internet. Berners-Lee noticed this risk and decided to take action. He developed a royalty-free network instead. At CERN, he integrated the preexisting TCP/IP and Hypertext technologies and created the first "World Wide Web."  Berners-Lee published the first website, which was self-serving (White Paper for the Web of Things | WPWT). The website described the world wide web and how to use it and invited collaborators to build on the technology. 

## III. Berners-Lee's motivations for royalty-free technology
