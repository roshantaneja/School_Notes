## Paragraph
From my historical understanding of the Reconstruction and Redemption periods, I believe that the circumstances that move our country closer to its founding ideals are those that promote equality, justice, and inclusivity. The Reconstruction era saw important strides towards achieving these goals, with the passage of legislation such as the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and the 14th Amendment. These laws sought to ensure the rights of African Americans and other marginalized groups, and represented a significant step towards creating a more fair and just society. On the other hand, the Gilded Age, which followed the Reconstruction era, saw a shift away from these ideals. The pursuit of profit and industrialization took precedence, leading to widespread exploitation and discrimination against racial and ethnic minorities. This period represents a move away from our country's founding ideals of equality and justice for all. Overall, it is clear that progress towards our country's founding ideals is not inevitable, but must be actively pursued and defended. When we prioritize the rights and well-being of all members of society, we move closer to realizing the vision of a fair and just society that our founders sought to create. However, when we prioritize the interests of the wealthy and powerful, we move further away from these ideals.

-   Many of the rules put in place to manage the hyper-rich were written __after__ the gilded age taught that there was little holding one back from extreme economic involvement. (3.4.1, 3.4.3)
-   Even to day there are a lot of tax rules that support the rich and should be rewritten to follow the ideals of equality, justice and inclusivity.
