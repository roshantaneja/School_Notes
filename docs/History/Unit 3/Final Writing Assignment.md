The Unit 3 Assessment, which you will complete during our Final Assessment period on Monday, December 12, will include three parts:

  

Part I: Terms Quiz (30 points)

This part of the assessment will look very similar to the terms quizzes we completed for Units 1 and 2. All terms on the daily handouts from Unit 3 (3-1, 3-2, 3-3, 3-4, 3-5, 3-6) listed with arrows or solid bullet points are fair game. You will not be assessed on terms with open bullet points.

  
  

Part II: Historical Analysis (50 points)

For this assignment, you will write one detailed paragraph of historical analysis (8-15 sentences). You may choose among these prompts: 

  

Option 1. 

How was the battle over the meaning of the Civil War in American memory fought during Reconstruction and Redemption?

In other words:

How did supporters of Redemption try to change the way Americans thought about the Civil War and the idea it should lead to a “new birth of freedom”?

  

Option 2.

How do we understand the history of Reconstruction and Redemption in relationship to the story of the Gilded Age?

In other words:

How was the labor of different racial groups exploited in similar and different ways during the Gilded Age (1880-1900)?

  

Option 3. 

How do we understand the history of Reconstruction and Redemption in relationship to the story of the final conquest of Indigenous Nations?

In other words:

How might ideologies of racial hierarchy helped justify both Redemption and Imperialism?

  
  

Part III: Historical Reflection (20 points)

Craft a thoughtful reflective paragraph (8-12 sentences) responding to the following prompt:

  

Based on your historical understanding of Reconstruction and Redemption, what lesson can we learn about what circumstances move our country closer to its founding ideals and what circumstances move our country farther from its founding ideals?

  

Requirements for Historical Analysis

  

-   Topic Sentence. Answer the question in a clear, direct sentence that makes an argument and addresses the prompt
    
-   Evidence. Provide 2 pieces of specific, detailed historical evidence to support your claim. Try to choose examples that are connected to each other in some way. 
    

-   Try to paraphrase most of your evidence -- explain what happened in your own words. For example, you might quote a brief phrase from the Declaration of Rights and Sentiments or a similar dynamic and exciting primary source,  but you should not include long quotes, and you definitely should not quote textbooks. 
    
-   Put your evidence in chronological order. This will help your historical narrative make sense and will often help you show how one example builds on another. 
    

-   Analysis. Connect the evidence clearly back to the argument. In this case, you should clearly explain how the evidence shows either a success or failure of democracy. Using language for specific features of democracy is a good strategy. Focus especially on linking specific facts from your evidence to your thesis.
    
-   Citation. Cite your evidence -- whether quoted or paraphrased --  using MLA-style parenthetical citation. For this assignment, you will generally cite like this (Class Notes, Day 24). Or, for a primary source, use the author’s last name (Walker). 
    

-   Writing Style. Proofread your writing to make sure that it is easy for a reader to understand and doesn’t contain major grammatical or syntax errors. Write in past tense. Practice academic writing style by avoiding “I,” “me,” “you,” or “we.” 
    
-   Format Make sure your name and period is on top of the page in MLA block. Double space and 12 font.
    
-   Use the Google Doc on Schoology, and submit your work to Schoology when you are finished.
