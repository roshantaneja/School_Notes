John 13:1-17

Thesis: Before the last supper, Jesus had come to terms with his imminent death and taught the disciples that nobody is above service and they must continue to serve when he is gone.

  

- Jesus has come to terms with his imminent death.
	- Jesus knew that Judas sold him out already, so he went to the upper room to have the last supper.
	- “Jesus too has been described as fearful and unsettled at heart.” (McCarren)
	- “Jesus’ teaching has been an extended conversation about the possibility of giving oneself completely to the God who gives himself completely to you” (McCarren)
	- In the days leading up to his execution, Jesus wanted to spread his teachings so that they would perpetuate even after he was gone. Due to his lack of time, his acceptance of death motivated him to perform these teachings whenever and to whomever.
- He loved the disciples and fully believed that he was from god and would return to god.
	- “But Jesus knew the father had put everything into his hands; he knew he came from God and was going to God.”(John 13:3)
	- Jesus started washing his disciples' feet in the upper room in Jerusalem.
- Peter told Jesus, “You will never wash my feet.”
	- Jesus said that Peter would have no inheritance with him unless he washed him.
	- “Peter is described as confounded by what he sees as an inappropriate reversal of roles.”(McCarren)
	- “Because Jesus is ‘Lord,’ he shouldn't be washing feet.”(McCarren)
- Jesus uses the washing of others' feet as a method of teaching that nobody is above service.
	- “We hear Jesus instructing his disciples to explore the possibility that if he, their master teacher – their lord – finds satisfaction in serving, the same might be true for them. (McCarren)
	- “You call me the teacher, the lord. That's right, I am. If I, the teacher, the lord, washed your feet, you should wash each others feet. I gave you an example. Do what I did.” (John 13:13-15)
