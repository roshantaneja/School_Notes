* The best preparation for college is to fully engage in your high school experience.
* being intentional about your choices is all that is required of you at this time.
* Don't ask "What do the colleges want to see?" bcuz then you're just doing what they want to see you do.
	* Doing your own thing and becoming your best self is what the colleges want to see.
* you don't have to be well rounded to get into college, the point of the people is to create a well rounded group and sometimes that requires specialists.
* You don't have to take a bunch of APs to get into colleges.
	* you shouldn't peak in APs in Junior Year.
* Your GPA doesn't matter most. its not the first thing that the admissions officers check first
* Build a strong foundation and don't skip the subjects that you will find difficult.
