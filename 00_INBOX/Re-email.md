Subject: Request for Guidance on Career Path in Computer Science 

Dear Professor ,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is [Your Name] and I am a high school student passionate about pursuing a career in Computer Science. I am reaching out to you given your vast knowledge and experience in this field and would appreciate any guidance you could provide regarding my future endeavors.

Over the past few years, I have found myself particularly captivated by computer science, engaging in several programming projects to enhance my understanding and skills. These projects have involved different domains such as Python, Machine Learning, Java, and more. This exposure has fostered my problem-solving, collaboration, and communication skills, along with a strong foundation in programming.

Here are some of the projects I have engaged in:

1. [Text Vectorization](https://github.com/Daroshi11260/TextVectorization): An implementation of TF-IDF algorithm and word2vec model for the purpose of text vectorization.

2. [Space Invaders with Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/Daroshi11260/spaceinvaders-reinforcementlearning): A project where I attempted to train an AI agent to play the classic Space Invaders game using Deep Q-learning.

3. [AP Computer Science A](https://github.com/Daroshi11260/APCSA): A collection of various Java assignments and projects showcasing my fluency in the language.

4. [Competitive Programming](https://github.com/Daroshi11260/competitive-programming): A collection of solutions to various challenging problems from popular competitive programming platforms, highlighting my problem-solving skills.

5. [School Notes](https://github.com/Daroshi11260/School_notes): A repository of my school notes and assignments, illustrating my organization and time management skills.

Although I have made some strides independently, I recognize the importance of mentorship and guidance. I am hopeful that a discussion with you could provide insight into the various opportunities and paths in computer science, helping me make informed decisions about my future academic and professional journey.

If you would be available for a meeting, whether it be in person, over a call, or even via email, I would be immensely grateful. I am eager to gain a deeper understanding of computer science and how to further involve myself in this exciting field.

Thank you in advance for your time and consideration. I look forward to the opportunity to learn from your expertise and insights.

Best Regards,
