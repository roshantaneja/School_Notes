Subject: Partnership Proposal for an Internship at Fluxon - Diverse Skills & Profound Interest

Dear Mr. Freedman,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Roshan, and I am currently a student with an interest in language learning models and AI. I am reaching out to express my interest in interning at your esteemed company, Fluxon.

Over the past few years, I have engaged in a multitude of programming projects, both personal and academic, which have allowed me to gain a diverse set of skills and a deep understanding of software development. Specifically, my projects have revolved around Python, Machine Learning, Java, and various other technologies. These experiences have not only refined my technical abilities but also honed my problem-solving, collaboration, and communication skills.

Here are some of the projects I have worked on that I believe align well with Fluxon's work:

1. [Text Vectorization](https://github.com/Daroshi11260/TextVectorization): An implementation of TF-IDF algorithm and word2vec model for the purpose of text vectorization.

2. [Space Invaders with Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/Daroshi11260/spaceinvaders-reinforcementlearning): An attempt to train an AI agent to play the classic Space Invaders game using Deep Q-learning. 

3. [AP Computer Science A](https://github.com/Daroshi11260/APCSA): A collection of various Java assignments and projects showcasing my fluency in the language. 

4. [Competitive Programming](https://github.com/Daroshi11260/competitive-programming): A collection of solutions to various challenging problems from popular competitive programming platforms, highlighting my problem-solving skills.

5. [School Notes](https://github.com/Daroshi11260/School_notes): A repository of my school notes and assignments, illustrating my organization and time management skills. 

I firmly believe that with the skills and experience I have garnered from these projects, I can make a valuable contribution to any team or project at Fluxon. I am particularly fascinated by the work Fluxon does in the field of personalized large language models and would love the opportunity to contribute to your pioneering work in the AI space.

Additionally, my father (Abhinav Taneja) mentioned the potential planning of an internal hackathon at Fluxon. Such events are not only a tremendous opportunity for innovation and collaboration, but also a platform where I can apply and expand my skills in a real-world setting. I would be thrilled to participate or even assist in the organization of such an event, showcasing my organizational skills and enthusiasm for team-oriented programming.

Attached with this email is my resume, which further details my academic background and technical skills. I am open to taking on any projects or tasks where my skills could be of use, and I am more than willing to learn and adapt to any new technologies or methodologies that I may need to use.

Thank you very much for considering my proposal. I look forward to the possibility of working with your innovative team and contributing to the exciting work you are doing at Fluxon.

Best Regards,

Roshan Taneja
