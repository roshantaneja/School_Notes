| The course expanded my insight about ethics in general. It also put the principles of ethics into real life situations where I could clearly see how ethics played a role in these particular situations. It also gave me insight to these general principles of ethics are often violated as the are other priorities which come into play.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                             | FALSE                                                                                                       | FALSE                                                                                                                  | FALSE                                                                                                                                    | FALSE                                                                                                        | FALSE                                                                                                                                          | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Ethics are important when building system or implementing new technologies. Ethics focuses on what is best for people in general, avoiding biases and discrimination. It is important to take ethics in consideration as expose us to contrasting ethical opinions, they also provide an opportunity to understand the reasons behind the differences. Ethics is important to reinforce or maybe change our values and ethical decision-making process. In this class, I learned the different approaches that ethics make in different situations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                             | FALSE                                                                                                       | FALSE                                                                                                                  | FALSE                                                                                                                                    | FALSE                                                                                                        | FALSE                                                                                                                                          | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                              |
| The course taught me about how important it is for discussions on ethics surrounding technology and its constant innovation to continue taking place. Having a code of ethics in place is like instating the rule of law over what actions and behaviors are right or wrong, and such restrictions being implemented could prevent technology from being used for nefarious reasons. In a way, it keeps technology, or rather the people who wield it, in check and ensures they are not overstepping into the realm of unethical practices.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                             | FALSE                                                                                                       | FALSE                                                                                                                  | FALSE                                                                                                                                    | FALSE                                                                                                        | FALSE                                                                                                                                          | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                              |
| The different readings about the ethical principles and guidelines provided a lot of insight of the different ethical perspectives and theories. I learned that it is important to design new forms of technology that are ethical. We have to ensure that it is beneficial towards society and how these new forms of technology can contribute good ethics. Learning the different theories was also another great way to interpret technology and how it plays a significant role. The choices that we make impact our future and that is what is important to consider when developing innovative technology.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                             | FALSE                                                                                                       | FALSE                                                                                                                  | FALSE                                                                                                                                    | FALSE                                                                                                        | FALSE                                                                                                                                          | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                              |
| The course taught me that understanding ethics mean having an open and wide perspective, as technology is the "vast unknown." There's a lot we don't know about technology and there may be times where we cannot predict when ethics will be compromised, so understanding the bigger picture is what I learned throughout this course. The discussions showed me diverse opinions of my classmates and gave me a new understanding.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                             | FALSE                                                                                                       | FALSE                                                                                                                  | FALSE                                                                                                                                    | FALSE                                                                                                        | FALSE                                                                                                                                          | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                              |
| This course taught me so much about ethics. It taught me how ethics is apart of our daily lives whether we choose to see it or not. Ethics play such a huge role in real life, human interaction and in the technology that we use all day, everyday. I never knew that there were ethics being considered when it came to the use and function of our everyday technology, especially things like social media. I felt that I knew what an overview definition of ethics were before this course but now I understand the deeper definition and true role that ethics is and plays in our society.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                             | FALSE                                                                                                       | FALSE                                                                                                                  | FALSE                                                                                                                                    | FALSE                                                                                                        | FALSE                                                                                                                                          | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                              |
| This course made me realize that I need to ask the question "Why?" and think bigger when it comes to working in the technological field and helping its development. Though it would be easy to take any job, I feel like a lot of these ethical dilemmas came from just those doing their job without thinking of the bigger picture.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                             | FALSE                                                                                                       | FALSE                                                                                                                  | FALSE                                                                                                                                    | FALSE                                                                                                        | FALSE                                                                                                                                          | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                              |
| This course has taught me many things about ethics. For example, I understand that ethics in information technology is the study of the ethical issues arising out of the use and development of electronic technologies. Additionally, its goal is to identify and formulate answers to questions regarding the moral basis of individual responsibilities and actions, and the moral underpinnings of public policy. I learned that ethics is extremely important in technology because ethical issues constitutes the condition for human attitudes and values that specify both human actions and behavior, and implying conditions for usefulness and maintenance of such systems. Also, I learned that personal privacy is an important aspect of ethical issues in information technology as information technology facilitates the users having their own personal hardware, operating system, as well as software tools in order to access the servers that are connected to each other and the to the users by a network.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                             | FALSE                                                                                                       | FALSE                                                                                                                  | FALSE                                                                                                                                    | FALSE                                                                                                        | FALSE                                                                                                                                          | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                              |

A lot to think about when developing and using technology because of how it can be used for how it was intended for and how it can be used for bad.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                             | FALSE                                                                                                       | FALSE                                                                                                                  | FALSE                                                                                                                                    | FALSE                                                                                                        | FALSE                                                                                                                                          | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Ethics is centered on well-established moral standards that dictate what humans should do, generally in terms of rights, duties, societal advantages, justice, or special qualities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                             | FALSE                                                                                                       | FALSE                                                                                                                  | FALSE                                                                                                                                    | FALSE                                                                                                        | FALSE                                                                                                                                          | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Overall, I was able to learn that we all should respect and keep the ethics of each people. Ethics consist of the rules of behaviors that people should follow. This allows how people should behave in a specific situation. Also, ethics is a system of principle that helps us tell right from wrong which gives real and practical guidance to our lives. Therefore, through this course, it taught me that ethics is a behavior that we should respect and follow.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                             | FALSE                                                                                                       | FALSE                                                                                                                  | FALSE                                                                                                                                    | FALSE                                                                                                        | FALSE                                                                                                                                          | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                              |

Before this class, I never related ethics as something that needed to be considered when using a technology, but my view has grown wider and focus more on people than the technology.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                             | FALSE                                                                                                       | FALSE                                                                                                                  | FALSE                                                                                                                                    | FALSE                                                                                                        | FALSE                                                                                                                                          | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                              |
| This course taught me that it is important to take moral consideration into effect rather than just think about what is more efficient.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                             | FALSE                                                                                                       | FALSE                                                                                                                  | FALSE                                                                                                                                    | FALSE                                                                                                        | FALSE                                                                                                                                          | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                              |
| This course taught me that ethics are an important thing to consider whenever making a decision. From theoretical decisions, determining proper course of action, or deciding what obligations someone has; ethics play a large role in what we decide and what the outcome will be. It is important to consider others perspectives and upbringings in order to attain a larger scale of a situation and what the best course of action would be to solve said situation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                             | FALSE                                                                                                       | FALSE                                                                                                                  | FALSE                                                                                                                                    | FALSE                                                                                                        | FALSE                                                                                                                                          | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                              |

| Overall, ethics are what individuals make out of it. There are those who value these ethics more than others and some does not even care. There has to be a balance when making decisions to benefit both sides and understand what the outcome may be. From these case studies, I personally believe that there are no gray areas when it came to ethics and it was clear as day to determine if decisions were black or white.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                             | FALSE                                                                                                       | FALSE                                                                                                                  | FALSE                                                                                                                                    | FALSE                                                                                                        | FALSE                                                                                                                                          | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                              |

| Mostly what I learned from the role plays - ethics needs to be upheld at all levels, it doesn't have a right/wrong answer, it's not always 100% fair, and inclusivity. In general, I would say that my biggest takeaway about ethics is that it's not black or white. Coming into the class, I had a very strict view of ethics - there are things that are definitely right and things that are definitely wrong. However, I think that all of the material in the class has done a good job of showing that a lot of things are dependent on so many factors and considerations. What's right for me isn't universally right.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                             | FALSE                                                                                                       | FALSE                                                                                                                  | FALSE                                                                                                                                    | FALSE                                                                                                        | FALSE                                                                                                                                          | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                              |
| This course taught me that you need to have a broad understanding of the topics you're discussing in order to get the full view of how ethics comes into play. You must take into account all angles on how to approach a topic, and think of each outcome and how it may affect those it relates to. There's no one right answer, and personally, no way to keep everyone happy in every scenario, but you can definitely do your best to get as many people on board as possible to all work together.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                             | FALSE                                                                                                       | FALSE                                                                                                                  | FALSE                                                                                                                                    | FALSE                                                                                                        | FALSE                                                                                                                                          | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                              |
| The course has taught me to first not be clouded by potential benefits when examining/creating technologies, but always keep in mind of the virtuous ethics that originated when creating the product. Furthermore, this class has taught be to break down various components to come towards a conclusion on whether or not I should support a innovative piece of technology.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                             | FALSE                                                                                                       | FALSE                                                                                                                  | FALSE                                                                                                                                    | FALSE                                                                                                        | FALSE                                                                                                                                          | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Predictably, ethics are complex, but how technology complicates them was not something I put enough thought into at first. Technology solves many material problems, but seems to create many more ethical problems via the drawbacks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                             | FALSE                                                                                                       | FALSE                                                                                                                  | FALSE                                                                                                                                    | FALSE                                                                                                        | FALSE                                                                                                                                          | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Overall, I learned that with the rapid evolution of information technology, it is essential to understand security concerns, privacy concerns, and the overall negative effects of IT.  We always look at the benefits or new features when there is a new technology and we use it, but we never really think of how it might affect someone or something. One main thing I learned with the readings, videos, and role play scenario is how easily our privacy can be harmed. Another thing is how companies always put their profitability ahead of the safety of their consumers. So, we should always be careful while using and being involved in different types of technologies and consider all the potential problems it might cause not just us, but everyone else.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                             | FALSE                                                                                                       | FALSE                                                                                                                  | FALSE                                                                                                                                    | FALSE                                                                                                        | FALSE                                                                                                                                          | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                              |
| This course brought to my attentions a lot of different issues within the realm of technology and AI. I learned about so many problems I wasn't aware of before in so many different spheres of life and tech. This course taught me the importance of privacy as a human right and inclusivity and equality or all. I learned about the difference between ethics, as the philosophy behind and study of morality, and morals which are our society's ideas on what is good and bad. I learned about importance of ethics and professionalism in the work place. This course also taught me about difference ideas of ethics from different philosophers and what they believed ethics to be. And finally I was taught about human behavior within our tech-based world and the way in which morality and immorality manifest as well as ways we can encourage the former and deter the latter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                             | FALSE                                                                                                       | FALSE                                                                                                                  | FALSE                                                                                                                                    | FALSE                                                                                                        | FALSE                                                                                                                                          | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Ethics is not something we should look past and much less ignore.  These are the foundational rules which a company should operate and follow. With ethics put in place, this allows for more probable participation among associates. Ethics allow for people to share the same morals and that is keeping the best interest of the company in mind. Ethics is crucial to any kind of business as well as products to provide proper business practices.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                             | FALSE                                                                                                       | FALSE                                                                                                                  | FALSE                                                                                                                                    | FALSE                                                                                                        | FALSE                                                                                                                                          | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                              |
| I learned that overall making moral choices builds and maintains trust.

With that, I understood perspectives better and hence that helped be understand different perspectives on ethics / values as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                             | FALSE                                                                                                       | FALSE                                                                                                                  | FALSE                                                                                                                                    | FALSE                                                                                                        | FALSE                                                                                                                                          | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                              |
| This course teach me about how technology is a great tool to use in our life's but also we have to evaluates and apply our ethics on. Since, we like human being have a brain that can difference between good and bad, we have to use when we create technology. In my personal experience technology is great but if technology is on bad hands this could harm so bad. You have in your hands a powerful tool that is technology, but you should use it with wisdom.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                             | FALSE                                                                                                       | FALSE                                                                                                                  | FALSE                                                                                                                                    | FALSE                                                                                                        | FALSE                                                                                                                                          | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                              |
| This course taught me plenty of things about ethics because there is always something to look into to make sure everyone is accounted for. In this class we learn that ethics makes people keep their promises, help people that need help, and guide people to speak the truth. Ethics are the concepts we differentiate good from bad. It defines how someone should behave in certain situations and what they should do that is right. Even when the law fails, we have ethics to help us from completely harming people. We use ethics everyday that make help us make important decisions that make positive changes instead of leading us to unjust outcomes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                             | FALSE                                                                                                       | FALSE                                                                                                                  | FALSE                                                                                                                                    | FALSE                                                                                                        | FALSE                                                                                                                                          | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                              |

Ultimately we make our own decisions, but sometimes we need to take into count what our choices can do to those around us.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                             | FALSE                                                                                                       | FALSE                                                                                                                  | FALSE                                                                                                                                    | FALSE                                                                                                        | FALSE                                                                                                                                          | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                              |
| I found that this class taught me about a lot more kinds of ethical issues I had never thought about or experienced before. Many were things I would call problems already but I didn't think of them as an ethical issue, such as accessibility and inclusiveness, my definition for ethical issues expanded. Additionally I never really thought about the fact that many new technological advancements would cause these type of ethical issues, I was aware of the Boeing case, or automation and AI putting people out of work but I was surprised to see that there were layers of ethical issues beyond that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                             | FALSE                                                                                                       | FALSE                                                                                                                  | FALSE                                                                                                                                    | FALSE                                                                                                        | FALSE                                                                                                                                          | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Overall, I feel like this course highlighted many lessons about ethics and how ethics relates to technology, very much so. It is so good that you included the TED Talk by Glenn Greenwald. In Glenn Greenwald's TED Talk, literally everything that this man said was true. People have no privacy on the internet anymore and technology tyranny is now on full display right before everybody's eyes. Nowadays, technology tyranny is about all we get, data gets deceptively manipulated without anybody knowing about it, surveillance systems get installed so that everybody can be surveillance, fake data gets manufactured by malicious individuals and then put on the internet (online propaganda/disinformation), innocent peoples privacy gets totally violated, innocent people get their name smeared and get their online footprint totally smeared, innocent people get arrested and put in jail because of unreliable facial recognition technology that law enforcement uses, unreliable software gets installed on airplanes and then horrible plane crashes happen and innocent people lose their lives because of technology tyranny.                                                                                                                 | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                             | FALSE                                                                                                       | FALSE                                                                                                                  | FALSE                                                                                                                                    | FALSE                                                                                                        | FALSE                                                                                                                                          | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Overall, this course taught me that the art of analyzing a case study, or anything really, to determine and develop a stance on the ethics of it is an extremely important part of a social environment.

| Overall this course taught me that ethics are very important to take into consideration when working with technology. Technology has the ability to automate tasks and make certain things more efficient and quick, but it is also equally as crucial to make sure that no one will be impacted negatively. Ethical issues can include negative impacts on the environment, discrimination issues, digital privacy, safety, and many more. Ethical dilemmas can also lessen the trust of the users that regularly use a technology. Therefore, it is very important to be informed on ethical and to implement ethical practices.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                             | FALSE                                                                                                       | FALSE                                                                                                                  | FALSE                                                                                                                                    | FALSE                                                                                                        | FALSE                                                                                                                                          | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                              |
| As the technology is progressive, ethical technological philosophy plays a vital role in shaping our society as it allows us to make choices and act accordingly. The basic principles of ethics made us think about the practical concerns about the technology, making decisions that are in the favor of community. This course has strengthen my knowledge about the security threats, misuse of personal identifiable information, moral use of data and maintaining the integrity of data so it is not violated in the hands of unauthorized individual. The second important element is the use of Artificial Intelligence and autonomous technology as if offers benefits in the industrial and farmers. Maintenance of data, limiting the data by offering the access of only authorized users only when they need to reduce the privacy threats.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                             | FALSE                                                                                                       | FALSE                                                                                                                  | FALSE                                                                                                                                    | FALSE                                                                                                        | FALSE                                                                                                                                          | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                              |
| I learned in this course that ethics is what holds us responsible and transforms us into better individuals. It inspires us to consider how our actions may affect others. Ethics teaches us to take into account others' thoughts and beliefs, even when they differ from our own. It enables us to be genuine with ourselves.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                             | FALSE                                                                                                       | FALSE                                                                                                                  | FALSE                                                                                                                                    | FALSE                                                                                                        | FALSE                                                                                                                                          | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                              |
| I think the course taught me how ethics play a big role in technology and on society. In order for technology to have a great impact society, there needs to be ethical standards in place. It also taught me various ethical issues that are currently present when AI technologies are implemented, so there is a need to find solutions that meet ethical principles. Ethical issues that were discussed throughout the course include bias such as in algorithms, lack of privacy and transparency, data security, and discrimination in a lot of communities. All the scenarios were helpful to grasp how people in the real world deal with ethical problems regarding technology.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                             | FALSE                                                                                                       | FALSE                                                                                                                  | FALSE                                                                                                                                    | FALSE                                                                                                        | FALSE                                                                                                                                          | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                              |
| The course taught me that when I think about ethics, I should consider many things and ensure that everything works as intended and everything is done well intentionally. The course also helped me to take my own life seriously and ensure to make the right decisions and choices. Considering ethics will help us think in a better way and be moral if we use it the right way.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                             | FALSE                                                                                                       | FALSE                                                                                                                  | FALSE                                                                                                                                    | FALSE                                                                                                        | FALSE                                                                                                                                          | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                              |

| Ethics permits you to assess the impact of your actions, choices, and decisions on both you and people around you. It is critical to learn about and understand so that you can apply them in your daily life. Having a lack of ethics can harm others around us and lead to tragic consequences. Ethics enables us to be transparent and assists us in making judgments that have a positive influence while directing us away from unfavorable consequences. I can see how crucial ethics is in IT.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                             | FALSE                                                                                                       | FALSE                                                                                                                  | FALSE                                                                                                                                    | FALSE                                                                                                        | FALSE                                                                                                                                          | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                              |
| This course taught me about how to look at some situations from a deeper perspective rather than just it is what it is or simply accepting certain aspects of a situation. For example, I believe now I will have an easier time looking for if something is transparent, does not violate privacy in an unfair or abusive way, and also to make sure things are included. I felt I had a good time finding it something had bias or discrimination to it but overall I learned a lot of positive aspects from this course about ethics.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                             | FALSE                                                                                                       | FALSE                                                                                                                  | FALSE                                                                                                                                    | FALSE                                                                                                        | FALSE                                                                                                                                          | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                              |

It also teaches me that we should always consider others viewpoints while doing something.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                             | FALSE                                                                                                       | FALSE                                                                                                                  | FALSE                                                                                                                                    | FALSE                                                                                                        | FALSE                                                                                                                                          | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Fortunately, IT-304 taught and instructed myriads and countless aspects about ethics. For instance, the main goals of ethics include human dignity, respect for all human life, the need to fight against false information spreading as truth, and finding the truth in both sides of ethical arguments. Thinking incorrectly, society believes ethics may be developed from a vote of the majority. However, ethics consists of the science of learning the moral law to attain the goal of the Greatest Good. If a human correctly and follows the precepts described in the moral law, which fulfill him as a human person, the human person may attain his proper end of achieving the Greatest Good.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                             | FALSE                                                                                                       | FALSE                                                                                                                  | FALSE                                                                                                                                    | FALSE                                                                                                        | FALSE                                                                                                                                          | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                              |
| My understanding of ethics before this class was just as simple as what standards guide my decisions, action, and way of thinking or what makes something good or bad. From this class ethics means to me integrity which is doing what is right even when no one is watching. IT also teaches me about the work, professional and societal responsibilities where the behavior, thinking, and actions should be valued as fair and right.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                             | FALSE                                                                                                       | FALSE                                                                                                                  | FALSE                                                                                                                                    | FALSE                                                                                                        | FALSE                                                                                                                                          | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                              |

| Overall this course taught me about integrity when it comes to ethics, Integrity is the practice of being honest and showing a consistent and uncompromising adherence to strong moral and ethical principles and values. In ethics, integrity is regarded as the honesty and truthfulness or accuracy of one's actions. With this course I was able to learn on how to express my gratitude when the team members were helping each other, respecting the opinions of others, being honest open about the topic and being patient and flexible to those who are having a hard time making a schedule on when they are free to do these role-play discussions, in the end it all worked out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                             | FALSE                                                                                                       | FALSE                                                                                                                  | FALSE                                                                                                                                    | FALSE                                                                                                        | FALSE                                                                                                                                          | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Firstly, this course went over and taught me that there are more ethical themes than I thought. This course went over bias/discrimination, inclusion, privacy, transparency, and even more than that, what I learned from the readings and lecture videos from week to week. I got more in-depth teaching on how these ethical themes can intertwine and be shown in different lights through the case study discussions. Seeing different points of view on the matters and the ethical dilemmas helped me to better understand them overall.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                             | FALSE                                                                                                       | FALSE                                                                                                                  | FALSE                                                                                                                                    | FALSE                                                                                                        | FALSE                                                                                                                                          | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                              |

| Overall, this course taught me that most new technology ideas, however beneficial they are, come with ethical concerns. Transparency, privacy, inclusion, and fairness is something that all companies need to consider and implement when creating a new public product. The products were all very innovative and were assets, however, they need to be secured for data privacy, open and public about their records, and easily accessible to all in an equal way.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                             | FALSE                                                                                                       | FALSE                                                                                                                  | FALSE                                                                                                                                    | FALSE                                                                                                        | FALSE                                                                                                                                          | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                              |
| That when dealing with technology in the modern world, ethics can be easily blurred. We want to see the success of technology since we are building the future. However, the problems that arise are something to focus on too. To build the future everyone must be on the same page. If the moral of the tech is in question then assurance must be provided to all parties.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                             | FALSE                                                                                                       | FALSE                                                                                                                  | FALSE                                                                                                                                    | FALSE                                                                                                        | FALSE                                                                                                                                          | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Before I started this course, I had never realized how important ethics was in society or how important ethics was when it came to determining which decisions were the best. From my understanding, I believe that ethics is taking your own moral principles into consideration to determine if you are doing the right thing or if you are doing the wrong thing. From the case studies, readings, and videos that we had throughout the semester, ethics plays a huge role in what we do as people and the way that we live. There were many examples of individuals being "unethical" and I had heard that phrase before this course, but I had never understood what that meant until I was able to do my own research and answer my own questions to gain an understanding of what it meant to be "ethical" and "unethical." As a result, reading all the case studies, playing a role, and looking at scenarios from different points of view, helped me the most in determining what ethics really are. All the assignments we had in this course were beneficial for me and in terms of ethics, I believe that it will allow me to make better decisions, in the way that I will try to be more "ethical" when trying to determine if something is right or wrong. | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                             | FALSE                                                                                                       | FALSE                                                                                                                  | FALSE                                                                                                                                    | FALSE                                                                                                        | FALSE                                                                                                                                          | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                              |
| This course offered me new insight and perspective change about how ethics ties into every aspect of what a company or technological product aims to be. It taught me how ethical and moral standards and levels have to be met with equal recipients who are willing to implement. It taught me how in order for a company or product to be successful setting these standards is absolutely fundamental.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                             | FALSE                                                                                                       | FALSE                                                                                                                  | FALSE                                                                                                                                    | FALSE                                                                                                        | FALSE                                                                                                                                          | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                              |
| There is a much deeper story behind every technology, that often times we as technology consumers are not told. We must seek the entire story if we are to fully understand and be aware the influence, positive or negative, technologies have on the entire world. It is our responsibility to hold innovators accountable for every shortcut or bias they encourage or adopt - that is the only way we will foster true equality in an increasingly technological world.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                             | FALSE                                                                                                       | FALSE                                                                                                                  | FALSE                                                                                                                                    | FALSE                                                                                                        | FALSE                                                                                                                                          | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Ultimately the course taught me that ethics does not only involve you and your actions, but how they affect everyone around you. Being oblivious to problems around you does no good especially as an IT professional. Ethics should also not be seen in retrospect, but in anticipation to future problems. This goes farther in ensuring that everyone has equal opportunities without past status quos negatively affecting them. Technology is great but it cannot be expected to do all the work. Doing what is right is requires both the humans and AI to work in tandem.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                             | FALSE                                                                                                       | FALSE                                                                                                                  | FALSE                                                                                                                                    | FALSE                                                                                                        | FALSE                                                                                                                                          | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                              |

| Overall, this class has helped me grow professionally and personally, and really challenged me to assess my core values and find out who I am. I learned transparency in technology, because it helps me gain more trust in a relationship. I am also responsible for what I say and decide. It is very important in AI technology. Because today, we use AI or Robot technology a lot, so responsibility is indispensable. Finally, the ethics of the production of goods must be dedicated and ethical in the profession.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                             | FALSE                                                                                                       | FALSE                                                                                                                  | FALSE                                                                                                                                    | FALSE                                                                                                        | FALSE                                                                                                                                          | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                              |

| This course taught me that not having simple ethics implemented can result in company losses and personal losses. A perfect example is the case study with Boeing. The ones who investigated the plane did not do a proper job and as of a result caused deaths and ruining many of the Boeing assets. Overall, this course taught me many things, but it taught me the significance of having basic ethics in a professional setting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                             | FALSE                                                                                                       | FALSE                                                                                                                  | FALSE                                                                                                                                    | FALSE                                                                                                        | FALSE                                                                                                                                          | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                              |
| That ethics are not as fluid as they seem, and that morality is not as subjective as many people may think. It seems that such a concept exists only to give respite to those who do not have morals or ethics that can be considered statistically good.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                             | FALSE                                                                                                       | FALSE                                                                                                                  | FALSE                                                                                                                                    | FALSE                                                                                                        | FALSE                                                                                                                                          | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Before this course I thought that ethics were kind of straight forward and easy problems to solve. I have since learned that there are many ethical issues the world is facing and that it is not an easy fix. There are many factors to take into consideration for the final solution to benefit both parties.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                             | FALSE                                                                                                       | FALSE                                                                                                                  | FALSE                                                                                                                                    | FALSE                                                                                                        | FALSE                                                                                                                                          | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                              |

| I personally think everyone sees ethics differently when it comes to technology. For example, big corporations usually do not consider privacy and other safety concerns that a technology can have as long as they are convinced that a product is profitable. A lot of things will be hidden from general public, until something really bad happens or someone is hurt. Even then big corporations they will try to hide the truth until they can't. Regular people usually suffer from such bad decisions and pay the ultimate price.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                             | FALSE                                                                                                       | FALSE                                                                                                                  | FALSE                                                                                                                                    | FALSE                                                                                                        | FALSE                                                                                                                                          | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                              |
| This course taught me that ethics plays a more significant role in almost everything we will learn when entering our career fields.  I learned from the case studies and role plays and was put in a position where I had to know why specific ideas were ethical and why others were not.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                             | FALSE                                                                                                       | FALSE                                                                                                                  | FALSE                                                                                                                                    | FALSE                                                                                                        | FALSE                                                                                                                                          | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                              |
| This class has taught me a lot about ethics primarily in green IT and data gathering. Granted, these are common sense, however, concepts like green IT are not mentioned in everyday work or even seen in the news because it is already considered "green". Data gathering is always an ethics question from not just gathering it, but also using it and displaying that data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                             | FALSE                                                                                                       | FALSE                                                                                                                  | FALSE                                                                                                                                    | FALSE                                                                                                        | FALSE                                                                                                                                          | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                              |
| This course taught me that everyone has their own unique ethical standpoint on certain topics, however, when coming together we can ultimately agree and compromise on what should be the ethical norm in certain situations that would be the most beneficial in the society we live in today.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                             | FALSE                                                                                                       | FALSE                                                                                                                  | FALSE                                                                                                                                    | FALSE                                                                                                        | FALSE                                                                                                                                          | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                              |
| This course taught me how ethics and technology are already extremely involved and intertwined; also, how it will continue to become more connected in the future.  I learned about the societal impact technology can have in good ways, but also negative ways. Artificial Intelligence and all its different subsets were also impacting our society and how it could still be refined. How certain algorithms could be biased towards certain user groups and that could not always be intentional. How user privacy is of the upmost importance nonetheless, many users do not care how their data is being used. The idea that we may not know we are being watched or used as guinea pigs, but absolute could be without out our knowledge in certain situations. Also, how technology impacts our different thinking’s and philosophies due to concepts such as filter bubbles and algorithms that only display information, they think we would enjoy or come back to watch again. Finally, how sustainability and technology have a great impact on our society, but also many shortcoming on the implementation from trust, costs and ethics.                                                                                                                     | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                             | FALSE                                                                                                       | FALSE                                                                                                                  | FALSE                                                                                                                                    | FALSE                                                                                                        | FALSE                                                                                                                                          | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                              |

| I learned how to use a logical understanding of right and wrong that outlines what people should and shouldn't do in terms of justice, virtues, obligations, or rights through this course. It is certainly hard to handle certain situations but through the role play i found out that looking through each persons perspective is important before taking any decision. Moreover, To make sure that our standards are realistic, I believe it is important to constantly review them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                             | FALSE                                                                                                       | FALSE                                                                                                                  | FALSE                                                                                                                                    | FALSE                                                                                                        | FALSE                                                                                                                                          | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                              |
| It taught be there is a clear distinction from right and wrong, but you must understand the full context, the intentions of all parties involved in the incident and allow for your moral compass to guide you given you know all the facts. I learned that big corporations can find ways to scheme people who are not careful.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                             | FALSE                                                                                                       | FALSE                                                                                                                  | FALSE                                                                                                                                    | FALSE                                                                                                        | FALSE                                                                                                                                          | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Overall I feel this course taught me very well about ethics when it comes to technology. Before this course I really never paid attention to the consequences of certain decisions. Now I see, especially with all the case studies all the little side paths and unintended consequences that could develop if ethics is not involved as well as how integral it is in our daily lives.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                             | FALSE                                                                                                       | FALSE                                                                                                                  | FALSE                                                                                                                                    | FALSE                                                                                                        | FALSE                                                                                                                                          | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                              |

| This course taught me a lot about the Ethics of developing technology and how without a mindset of Ethics into play before developing certain technologies, tragedies such as the Boeing 757 MAX incident occur so it is extremely vital to keep Ethics in mind.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                             | FALSE                                                                                                       | FALSE                                                                                                                  | FALSE                                                                                                                                    | FALSE                                                                                                        | TRUE                                                                                                                                           | FALSE                                                                                                                                                                              |

It is important to discuss and think of the consequences of technology and how to remove bias and other ethical issues from technology.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | TRUE                                                                                                                                                                              | FALSE                                                                                                       | FALSE                                                                                                                  | FALSE                                                                                                                                    | FALSE                                                                                                        | TRUE                                                                                                                                           | TRUE                                                                                                                                                                               |
