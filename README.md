I made a private repo to keep my school notes here because sometimes I forget to take notes, so now I feel motivated.

There are easier ways to take notes, but I also forget my laptop when I go to school, making it much easier to find my notes on my phone or someone else's computer if I forget my laptop.

### Counter of Forgotten laptop days (updating):

### 48

<s>now theres a live site hosted through gh-pages</s> (I just broke it, going to fix it soon)

Still working on styling and stuff but hopefully, this should be good
