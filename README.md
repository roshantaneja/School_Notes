# School_Notes
I made a private repo so I could keep my school notes in here because sometimes i forget to take notes so now I feel motivated to lmao.

There are easier ways to take notes, i know but i also keep forgetting my laptop when i go to school so this makes it much easier to find my notes on my phone or someone elses computer if i forget my laptop.

### Counter of Forgotten laptop days (updating):

#### 20

now theres a live site hosted through gh-pages

[daroshi11260.github.io/School_Notes/](https://daroshi11260.github.io/School_Notes/ "https://daroshi11260.github.io/School_Notes/")

still working on styling and stuff but hopefully this should be good
