## Paragraph
The history of Reconstruction and Redemption in relation to the story of the Gilded Age sheds light on the ways in which the labor of different racial groups was exploited in similar and different ways during this time period. Reconstruction and Redemption were two important periods in American history that took place during and after the Civil War, respectively. During Reconstruction, which lasted from 1865 to 1877, the federal government implemented a series of policies aimed at rebuilding the Southern states and ensuring the rights of newly freed African Americans. These policies included the passage of the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments to the Constitution, which abolished slavery, granted citizenship to all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and granted the right to vote to African American men, respectively. Redemption, on the other hand, was a period of time during which Southern states sought to reverse the gains made by African Americans during Reconstruction. This period, which lasted from roughly 1877 to 1900, saw the rise of Jim Crow laws and other forms of racial segregation, as well as the growth of lynching and other forms of racial violence. It was during this time that the Ku Klux Klan, a white supremacist organization, emerged and gained a significant following in the South. The Gilded Age, which took place from roughly 1880 to 1900, was a period of rapid economic growth and industrialization in the United States. It was also a time when the labor of different racial groups was exploited in similar and different ways. African Americans, for example, were largely confined to low-paying agricultural and domestic work, and were often subject to discrimination and violence. At the same time, many European immigrants, particularly those from Eastern and Southern Europe, were also working in low-paying, dangerous jobs in the industrial sector. The Gilded Age was a period of rapid economic growth in the United States, marked by the rise of large corporations and financial institutions. This period followed the Reconstruction era, during which the government sought to rebuild the country after the Civil War and ensure the rights of newly-freed African American slaves. The Reconstruction era saw the passage of important legislation, such as the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and the 14th Amendment, which granted citizenship and equal protection under the law to African Americans. However, despite these efforts, African Americans continued to face significant discrimination and oppression during the Gilded Age. Many were forced to work as sharecroppers on cotton plantations, often in conditions that were little better than slavery(3.3.5). Meanwhile, other racial and ethnic groups, such as Chinese immigrants, were also subject to exploitation and discrimination. In particular, Chinese immigrants were often forced to work on dangerous railroad construction projects and mining operations, where they were paid low wages and faced harsh working conditions. Overall, the Gilded Age was a period of great inequality and exploitation, with different racial and ethnic groups facing similar forms of oppression in the pursuit of profit. While the Reconstruction era had sought to address the legacy of slavery and ensure the rights of African Americans, these efforts were largely undone during the Gilded Age as the country's focus shifted towards industrialization and economic growth.
