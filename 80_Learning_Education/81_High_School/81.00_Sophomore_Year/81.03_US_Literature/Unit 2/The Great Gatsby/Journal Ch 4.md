Gatsby is first introduced to the reader through Nick's narration, and from the start, he is depicted as a mysterious and enigmatic figure. Throughout the chapter, we learn that Gatsby throws extravagant parties every weekend, yet no one seems to know much about him or his past. He is described as having a "romantic readiness" and being "an American, a great one." This suggests that Gatsby is a dreamer, someone who is always striving for something better, and that he is proud of his American identity.

Gatsby's past is shrouded in secrecy, and it is clear that he is not willing to share much about it. However, we do learn that he is from the Midwest and that he is an "Oxford man" which suggests that he is well-educated. He also tells Nick that he is an "Owl-eyed man" which suggests that he is wise and perceptive. Gatsby's primary motivation is his love for Daisy. He tells Nick that he has been in love with Daisy for five years and that he wants to be reunited with her. He is willing to do anything to win her back, including throwing these extravagant parties in the hopes that she will attend one of them. Gatsby's love for Daisy is described as "an extraordinary thing" and "an ecstasy" which suggests that his love for her is intense and all-consuming.

In conclusion, Gatsby is a complex and mysterious character, who is driven by his love for Daisy. He is a dreamer and a romantic, who is proud of his American identity. However, there are many questions that remain unanswered about his past, which makes him an intriguing and compelling character. 

Questions that I still have about Gatsby include:
* What is the true nature of his wealth?
* What is his background, and how did he acquire his wealth? It doesnt seem plausible that his relatives would just all suddenly die and leave so much wealth for him. 
* What is the reason behind his mysterious behavior? 

Overall, Gatsby's character is intriguing and complex, and I look forward to uncovering more about him as I continue reading the novel.
