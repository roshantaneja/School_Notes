 HURRAY, I HAVE THREE SOURCES! WHAT DO I DO NOW? 

If you finish finding three good primary sources during class, you can start working with your primary sources by reading them carefully and starting your Research Assignment 4 Analyzing Primary Sources assignment. You can find this on Schoology under the Research Project folder.


**Follow the instructions to organize your pre-writing and analysis of primary sources. 

  

Source 1:  Paula Ancona, Looking for a Job? Use your computer, Tuesday, December 13th, 1994

Context: List several facts about the source that you’d want to include in your writing -- what IS the source? who produced it? what was happening at the time? what’s the purpose of the source? etc.

	This article was created as an effort to get people interested in the business aspect of the internet. It shows that through electronic-mail and resume servers, its possible to get hired to positions that others (who dont use the internet) wouldnt be able to get into.
	It also says that other tools like software, fax machines, and cellular telephones will help organize and complete standard job-hunting tasks more efficently than traditional methods.
	The other article is a collection of tips and tricks on how to use the internet successfully.

Main Ideas. Explain in your own words some of the main ideas of the source. Explain in 1-2 sentences how it answers your research question. 

  
	  - The internet can be a place for business opportunities as well, not only a place for researchers.

	  - Many businesses were providing internet services to connect to the web within a decade of the development of the internet. Places like Delphi or compuserve all allowed the average person to use the internet.

Powerful Language + IN-TEXT CITATIONS. Drop in any direct quotes that you might want to include in your paper. It’s probably best to include too much, rather than too little, at this point. Put quotation marks around the quotes, and include the in-text citations.
