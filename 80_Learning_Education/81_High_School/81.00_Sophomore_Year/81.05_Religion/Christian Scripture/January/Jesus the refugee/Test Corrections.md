### Question 14

I choose the theme of the birth of Jesus and the visit of the shepherds

### Question 16

**Analysis #1 -** Explain in 2-4 sentences how the piece of evidence from the previous question supports youir chosen theme.

This quote makes reference to another descendant of David; his son, Solomon. In Wis 7:4-6, David also swaddled his son and laid him in a manger just like any other infant. This very discreet reference ensures that those who are looking for more proof of Jesus's lineage can understand that even though the point-blank modesty of the saviour of the world was once an infant in a manger, it still follows through that this is true for every great being that existed before him.

### Question 18

**Analysis #2 -** Explain in 2-4 sentences how the piece of evidence from the previous question supports youir chosen theme.

The announcement of Jesus' birth to the shepherds is in keeping with the theme of the narrative that the lowly are singled out as the recipients of gods favours. The basic message of the infancy narrative is contained in the angel's announcement: this child of these poor people is the saviour, Messiah and Lord. Luke is the only synoptic gospel to use the word "saviour" for Jesus. Again, Luke shows how the most modest of people are subject to gods favour.

### Question 20

**Analysis #3 -** Explain in 2-4 sentences how the piece of evidence from the previous question supports youir chosen theme.

When the shepherds finally reach baby Jesus in the manger, they realize what the angel had told them is true, and they praise and celebrate God because everything they discovered is true.

### Question 21

**Importance -** Now go deeper - why was this theme so important for the audience of this gospel and why is it important today? (3-5 sentences)

The theme of this infancy narrative is that god does not care if you are wealthy or poor. They care about if you are rich in heart and soul rather than if you have deep pockets. Through the evidence, we learned that god bestows their affection on those who are lowly or lower regarded in society. Not only that but the people that god picks are good of heart. The audience of the Gospel of Luke were Jewish Christians, and they understood the importance of lifting up other people to better society. So when the visitors of Jesus are Shepherds, its fitting because it shows that he started with humble beginnings and would be dedicated to the people of Israel.
