Lesson 7.10: What are communities doing now to deal with rising sea levels?

  

# REVIEW: 

1.  What did we learn last class about limiting reactants? 
    

  
  

2.  What questions do you still have about how we can predict the amount of product from a chemical equation?
    

WARM UP: 

3.  What problems are coastal communities facing as a result of sea level rise? 
    
  

INVESTIGATION

1. Solutions at that address glaciers melting

After reading your assigned section of the article:[Geoengineer polar glaciers to slow sea level rise](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rLBnwCzXssToRogfkSsgVv83kUMbWdEY/view?usp=sharing) circle the title of the section you are reading: 

1. Block warm water

2. Support ice shelves

3. Dry subglacial streams



1.  What is geoengineering of polar ice glaciers? 
    

  
  

2.  What 3 strategies are suggested in this article? 
    

  
  

3.  Choose 1 solution and describe in 1-3 sentences the overall mechanism that will help explain how the solution you modeled above will work to stop sea level rise. 
    

  
  

4.  Share the solution you read about and gather some information from your classmates about the other solutions. Which of the design solutions presented in class do you think has the most potential to stop sea level rise?
    

  
  
  
  

2. Local solutions

 Circle your group’s assigned design solution and complete the notes chart on the next page. Save the remaining pages for you to take notes when other groups share what they gathered in their investigations. You may not need to utilize every column of the notes chart.

| What did the design solution achieve for the community?                                                                                           | Allowed the community to respond to intense flooding that didn't destroy the whole city. This allows retaliation in a way that doesn't harm the coastline. Instead of seawalls that break ocean currents, the sponge cities allow people to participate in regular life but avoids the risk of flooding. |
| What was prioritized or neglected in this solution?                                                                                               | The people prioritized a response that didn't impact the environment in a way that seawalls or coastline guarding does. They neglected the issue of reversing government neglect as a method of reform.                                                                                                  |

NEXT STEPS:

1.  Reflect on today’s question: What are communities doing now to deal with rising sea levels? 
    
2.  Reflect on the unit question, how does today’s activity relate to the unit question? 
    
3.  Make sure all parts of the L7.10 student sheet are complete.
