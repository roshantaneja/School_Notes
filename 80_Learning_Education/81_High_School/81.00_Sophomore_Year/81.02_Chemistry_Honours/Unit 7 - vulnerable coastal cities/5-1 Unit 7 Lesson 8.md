*Lesson 7.8:  How much CO2 is added to the atmosphere from combustion?  

# Review:

1.  # What did we learn last class about weather, the atmosphere and the ideal gas law last lesson? 
    

  

2.  # Complete the IMT for Lesson 7.
    

  

Part 1: What is your car’s carbon emissions?

-   Use the [link](https://8billiontrees.com/carbon-offsets-credits/carbon-ecological-footprint-calculators/car-calculator/) to calculate your emissions per year. Scroll down the page until you see “Car Carbon Footprint Calculator”.  How many pounds of emissions are produced by your vehicle.  How can you account for these emissions?


__ H2(g)    +          __ O2(g)   →             __ H2O(l)

2.  oxygen gas(O2) = 
    
3.  water(H2O) =
    

  

2.  How many moles of water are produced from 2 moles of hydrogen gas?

For the next few problems, remember to use the road map to determining how to solve.

4.  Now, let’s try with the combustion of methane…

__ CH4(g)   +   __ O2(g)   →     __ CO2(g) +  __ H2O(l)

  
  

1.  How many grams of _______ are in 1 mole?

d. How many moles of methane and oxygen do you need to produce 10 moles of carbon dioxide? 

  
  
  

e. How many grams of carbon dioxide can you produce if you start with 121.2 grams of  CH4(g) and excess O2(g)?

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

f. How many grams of CH4(g) do you need to make 100.0g of carbon dioxide?

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

g. How many grams of CH4(g) do you need to make 200.0g of water? 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

Part 3: Stoichiometry Practice 

Use this equation for all calculations: ___C2H4(g) + ___O2(g) → ___CO2(g) + ___H2O(g)

1.  Calculate the number of grams of C2H4 that are required to produce 112.0 g H2O. (ans 87.11 g)
    

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

2.  Calculate the number of grams of CO2 that can be produced from 12.5 g of O2. (assume excess C2H4) (ans 11.5 g)
    

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

3.  This reaction was confined to a container with a pressure of 1.00 atm, and a temperature at 298 K. Calculate the number of liters of CO2 that are produced from 112.0 g C2H4 assuming the container remains closed. (Hint: use PV = nRT) (ans 196 L)
    

  

  

  

  

  

Part 4: Stoichiometry Application:  

How many liters of CO2 does the combustion of 1 gallon of gasoline produce?

  

Combustion reactions use a fuel, usually, a hydrocarbon that reacts with excess oxygen to form carbon dioxide gas and water vapor.  It has the generic equation CxHy + O2 → CO2 + H2O

  

Assume gasoline is primarily octane (C8H18).  Write the balanced equation for the combustion of octane.

 2C8H18 + 25O2 → 16CO2 + 18H2O

  

Claim: 1 gallon of gasoline burned in a combustion engine will produce ~4900 L of CO2 gas

  

Useful/Helpful information:

-   Density of gasoline = 0.7550 kg/L
    
-   1 gallon = 3.790 L so 1 gallon of gasoline has a mass of 2.860 kg
    
-   Gasoline is 84% Carbon 16% Hydrogen and has a molar mass of 114.0 g/mol
    
-   The combustion of gasoline will produce carbon dioxide and water.
