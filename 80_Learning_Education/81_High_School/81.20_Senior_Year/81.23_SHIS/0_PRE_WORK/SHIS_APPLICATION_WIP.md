### **Description of Experience of Independent Work**
Please describe in approximately 150 words an experience in which you have demonstrated your ability to work independently. Keep in mind any opportunity, group work, project, idea, passion or interest in which you have taken the initiative, followed through with completion, or pursued. Be as specific as possible.

In the realm of Computer Science and Machine Learning, I independently embarked on a project that exemplifies my passion and capabilities in the field: the development of a reinforcement learning agent for the game Space Invaders. Driven by my profound interest in machine learning, I set out to create an agent that could learn and improve its performance in the game over time, without any human intervention. Utilizing Python and Tensor-Flow, I implemented a Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm. This technique enabled the agent to evaluate its actions based on the state of the game, learning from its environment by maximizing the cumulative reward. The project required meticulous coding, extensive testing, and continuous refinement of the model's parameters to enhance its decision-making processes. Through this endeavor, not only did I deepen my understanding of reinforcement learning principles and algorithms, but I also honed my skills in problem-solving and algorithmic thinking. This project stands as a testament to my ability to independently navigate the complexities of machine learning, fueling my ambition to contribute innovative solutions within the field of computer science.

after the project, I documented the process in a google slideshow, in case anyone asked me about this project.



### **Guiding/Essential Questions**
List the Guiding/Essential Questions you are posing in your study that will guide your overall study and research.

- TOP LEVEL QUESTION: How do I use Publicly available satellite Information to Identify and accurately assess population Densities?
- How does object detection work?
- How can I use computer vision to recognize objects?
- Can I train an object detection area on 

### **Description of Content Areas**
Describe in approximately 200 words what you propose to study. Be as specific and as complete as possible.


### **Description of your motivation for pursuing this independent study**
Describe in 150 – 200 words what has motivated you to undertake this work, what specific approach(es) you plan to take in this study, and how this study fits into your overall academic values.


### **List of Objectives and Learning Goals**
List, in bullet points, the major learning objectives, outcomes or goals that you plan to accomplish by the end of your independent study. Begin your list of bullet points with the phrase, “By the end of my independent study, I intend to:…”


### **List and Description of Key Assignments and Major Assessments**
List and write a brief description of EACH key assignment and major assessment, with approximate number of pages (e.g., pp. 5 – 7) that will form the basis for assessment.
	PLEASE NOTE:
	1. For SHIS Applications through the English, Religious Studies, Fine Arts or World Languages department, your Paper #1 should be an “annotated bibliography” paper in which you will describe each source that you use, its theoretical perspective and contribution to the field, and explain its use for your project.
	1. ALSO: If your research or experiments include interview questions, surveys, questionnaires or human participants, you must complete the “Research Experiment Plan” and the “Human Informed Consent Form” documents in addition to this application. If your application is approved, you must have completed AP Statistics, or enroll in AP Statistics in your senior year, or complete an approved Statistics course over the summer in order to be able to analyze the data that you plan to collect.


### **Formal Bibliography of Proposed Resources**
List a minimum of ten (10) non-internet sources, including title, author and all publication information.  If you choose to include “internet” sources, they need to be credible and not just random websites, (i.e., from online websites such as academic and professional journals or databases, etc.)


Please use MLA or Chicago Style format, depending on your sponsoring department’s policy for works cited.
* e.g., MLA STYLE:
``` MLA
Author’s Last name, First name. “Title of the Article or Individual Page.” Title of the Website, Name of
	the Publisher, Date of Publication in Day Month Year format, URL.
```

## III. EMAIL OF AGREEMENT FROM THREE OFF-CAMPUS EXPERTS



## IV. EMAIL OF BRIEF RECOMMENDATION FROM A SACRED HEART TEACHER
verifying your ability to undertake and follow through on independent work of a sustained nature.



## V. EMAIL FROM PARENT/GUARDIAN
indicating an understanding of the SHIS program, its rigor and assessment guidelines, and support of the student’s application



## VI. BRIEF STATEMENT OF PREFERENCE FOR FALL OR SPRING SEMESTER
to include any compelling reason(s) for this preference. Please note that this preference is not guaranteed but rather considered in the process of evaluating and balancing independent study projects per semester.

==Deadline:==
Completed applications with all necessary attachments (complete course description, syllabus, emails
from mentors, email of recommendation from SHP teacher, email from parent or guardian, brief
statement of preference for fall or spring semester, AND human participant forms, if applicable) are
due, either ==via email in WORD format== to Mr. Ramos at jramos@shschools.org or uploaded in
