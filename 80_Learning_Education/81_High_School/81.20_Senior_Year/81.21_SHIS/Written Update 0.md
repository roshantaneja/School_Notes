With airplanes and satellites, we collect mountains of data of affected regions but who looks at this data? How do we turn this data into a physical response? The program’s goal is for participants to explore, leverage, and transform open source information and imagery collected from drones, airplanes, helicopters, and satellites to generate actionable intelligence to support a disaster or humanitarian response.<br><br>## Students will be exposed to three main components:<br><br>1) feature extraction from raw data,<br><br>2) classification via machine learning techniques, and<br><br>3) data products for decision makers. The program will explore tools and techniques using real world operational data collected from across the globe.<br><br>BWSI Remote Sensing program will offer students the opportunity to explore the exciting intersection of data science and disaster response. The program consists of two components: (1) online course from January to May, open to all interested and committed students; and (2) a four-week virtual summer program. During the course, the students will learn to understand the basics of Python, Git, GIS, machine learning, and image processing through a series of online teaching modules. Students will explore real world datasets featuring disaster imagery from both satellites and aerial platforms. Students in this course will develop experience in an area of data science that is poised to play a critical role in understanding our world.<br><br>### Online Course<br><br>Prior to the virtual summer course, students will be required to complete an online course which contains important introductory material. The online course will give the students a strong foundation required to successfully complete the four-week summer course. In addition to foundational introductory material, the online course includes discussion of different use cases and expose students to real world challenges and applications of the coursework.<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|Computer Science\|Data Science\|Real World Data\|<br>\|Getting started with Python\|Advanced NumPy\|Civil Air Patrol\|<br>\|Git & GitHub management\|Simple image classification\|USGS Landslide Assessment\|<br>\|Machine learning perspectives\|Introduction to Web Services\|Zanzibar Mapping Initiative\|<br><br>### Summer Course<br><br>The four-week summer component of aims to guide students through the processing of designing experiments to evaluate primarily text-based content.

# Computer Science Summer Institute – Intermediate Track

Get a head start on university computer science concepts

## Advance your skills in programming and data analysis

The Computer Science Intermediate Track provides a unique combination of coding boot camp, and lab touring experiences, as well as UCLA coursework covering critical concepts and skills in computer programming related to statistical inference, in conjunction with hands-on analysis of real-world datasets, including economic data, health data, geographical data, and social networks.

Computer science experience with basic programming skills (python) is required. Knowledge in basic matrix analysis, probability, and statistics is preferred.

## Computer Science Summer Institute – Intermediate Track

### Curriculum Overview

The fundamental question this course aims to address is how does one analyze real-world data so as to understand the corresponding phenomenon.  Students will learn critical concepts and skills in computer programming related to statistical inference, in conjunction with hands-on analysis of real-world datasets, including economic data, health data, geographical data, and social networks.   Planned topics include machine learning, data analytics, and statistical modeling classically employed for prediction. The program will be a blend of theoretical and practical instruction, providing a comprehensive, hands-on overview of the Data Science domain. 

Hands-on projects will form the bulk of the work for the class and will seek to teach students the data science lifecycle: data selection and cleaning, feature engineering, model selection, and prediction methodologies. 

### Commuter-Only Program

Computer Science Summer Institute – Intermediate Track is a commuter program, there is NO on-campus housing available for the Computer Science Intermediate program through the institute program or UCLA Summer Sessions. Additionally, please note that only students aged 17 and older as of June 24th, 2024 are eligible to sign a housing contract, and not all program dates correspond to when contracts are available. Students interested in exploring this option should review information at [UCLA Summer Housing](https://portal.housing.ucla.edu/summer-housing).

Participants of the Computer Science Summer Institute – Intermediate Track must commute to the UCLA campus each day of the program. Specific location information (e.g. classroom) will be provided to enrolled students closer to the start of the program.

Parking

Summer Sessions parking permits will be available on a first-come, first-served basis. Students have the option to purchase a summer term permit or a daily permit.

Please review the [Transportation and Parking Services web page](https://transportation.ucla.edu/campus-parking/students) and read the “Summer Quarter Parking (All Students)” section for more information on all permit types, including cost.

# EPS 7, Introduction to Climate Change, Summer A 2024

EPS 7 is online in summer session A of 2024. The lectures and exams will be on bCourses. The lectures will be asynchronous: they will post at the regular class time, but you can watch them at your leisure. On the other hand, the exams on bCourses will be synchronous: you must log in online at the specified time.

Note that this course covers the same material as the semester-long version of EPS 7, but in a third the time. Therefore, every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday will contain the same amount of content as a week of the semester-long version. This also means that homework assigned on a Monday is due on Wednesday just two days later, and likewise for homework assigned on Wednesdays and Fridays. And late homework is not accepted, so this summer course requires a high level of uninterrupted effort. Even with this intensity, however, the course will be just as much fun as the semester-long version!

## Overview

This course covers the physical processes that determine Earth's past, present, and future climate, with a particular focus on the essentially irreversible climate change (a.k.a., global warming) caused by the burning of coal, oil, and natural gas. Topics will also include the estimation of future warming and impacts, the Earth resources that can be used to combat climate change, and the policies being used to shift towards the use of those resources.

Time

Fridays 2:00-3:00 for exams

Lectures released mornings of M, W, and F

Location

In the bCourses Media Gallery

Required text

None

Readings will be posted online

Prerequisites

None

Grading

Homework 30% (on bCourses, due every M, W, and F)

Midterm II 20% (on bCourses, June 14, 2pm Pacific)

Final 30% (on bCourses, June 28, 2pm Pacific)

Letter grades are 90-100% for an A, 80-90% for a B, 70-80% for a C, etc., with each decile split into equal thirds to determine + and -.
