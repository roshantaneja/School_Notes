### **Description of Experience of Independent Work**
Please describe in approximately 150 words an experience in which you have demonstrated your ability to work independently. Keep in mind any opportunity, group work, project, idea, passion or interest in which you have taken the initiative, followed through with completion, or pursued. Be as specific as possible.

There are two things I love in this world: Computer Science and Retro Video Games. One of my favorite games is space invaders, so I decided to build a Reinforcement Learning agent to beat the game (because I never could). I utilized a Q-Network and a Target Network to calculate Q-values, optimizing the agent's decision-making process. The model learns as if it has played every possible move in the game prior and generates a policy based on those "experiences" to play better next round. The model simply learns from its mistakes, and maximizes its cumulative reward at the end. This approach involved storing experiences as tuples (state, action, reward, next state), refining the model through iterations, and adjusting weights. Through this endeavor, not only did I deepen my understanding of reinforcement learning principles and algorithms, but I also honed my skills in problem-solving and algorithmic thinking. The project's results demonstrated significant improvement in the agent's game performance, showcasing my ability to independently apply complex machine learning algorithms and neural networks in developing practical solutions and pursuing projects to completion.

### **Guiding/Essential Questions**
List the Guiding/Essential Questions you are posing in your study that will guide your overall study and research.

- ==TOP LEVEL QUESTION:== How do I use publicly available satellite Information to identify and accurately assess population densities?
	- How does object detection work?
	- How can I use computer vision to recognize objects?
	- How do satellites process Image Data?
	- Can I train an object detection model on raw satellite data?
	- Can I run an object detection model on raw satellite data?
	- What is the best scanning algorithm for a problem of this scale?
	- How do you assess the best locations to place water harvesting units using population density?

### **Description of Content Areas**
Describe in approximately 200 words what you propose to study. Be as specific and as complete as possible.

My SHIS will focus on the integration of Machine Learning and Remote Sensing into Environmental Sustainability. I want to investigate how these two fields of study can be used in parallel to accelerate humanitarian initiatives. So far, there hasn't been much involvement of computer science in the geographic imaging field, however,

### **Description of your motivation for pursuing this independent study**
Describe in 150 – 200 words what has motivated you to undertake this work, what specific approach(es) you plan to take in this study, and how this study fits into your overall academic values.

The Maasai women and children in the Monduli District of Tanzania walk over nine hours every day to collect water. Over the last four years, I have been working with this community, fundraising, and deploying water harvesting solutions in the area. So far, we have installed four units across the district. My field research confirms that water harvesting units have doubled educational and economic activity for over 4500 community members within a 10-mile radius, as access to water frees Maasai women to pursue economic endeavors and enables children to attend school. There are over 30,000 Maasai spread over 300 sq. miles. To scale this project, I want to find the most densely populated areas where I can place water units. There are no maps of where people live, no roads, just wilderness. So, I turned to satellite imagery. I want to train a object detection model to recognize housing units from public satellite data and create a density heatmap, pinpointing locations for future harvesting units. The model could pinpoint the 15 best locations to place water harvesting units to have the most impact.

### **List of Objectives and Learning Goals**
List, in bullet points, the major learning objectives, outcomes or goals that you plan to accomplish by the end of your independent study. Begin your list of bullet points with the phrase, “By the end of my independent study, I intend to:…”

==By the end of my independent study I intend for...==


### **List and Description of Key Assignments and Major Assessments**
List and write a brief description of EACH key assignment and major assessment, with approximate number of pages (e.g., pp. 5 – 7) that will form the basis for assessment.
	PLEASE NOTE:
	1. For SHIS Applications through the English, Religious Studies, Fine Arts or World Languages department, your Paper #1 should be an “annotated bibliography” paper in which you will describe each source that you use, its theoretical perspective and contribution to the field, and explain its use for your project.
	1. ALSO: If your research or experiments include interview questions, surveys, questionnaires or human participants, you must complete the “Research Experiment Plan” and the “Human Informed Consent Form” documents in addition to this application. If your application is approved, you must have completed AP Statistics, or enroll in AP Statistics in your senior year, or complete an approved Statistics course over the summer in order to be able to analyze the data that you plan to collect.


### **Formal Bibliography of Proposed Resources**
List a minimum of ten (10) non-internet sources, including title, author and all publication information.  If you choose to include “internet” sources, they need to be credible and not just random websites, (i.e., from online websites such as academic and professional journals or databases, etc.)


Please use MLA or Chicago Style format, depending on your sponsoring department’s policy for works cited.
* e.g., MLA STYLE:
``` MLA
Author’s Last name, First name. “Title of the Article or Individual Page.” Title of the Website, Name of
	the Publisher, Date of Publication in Day Month Year format, URL.

## VI. BRIEF STATEMENT OF PREFERENCE FOR FALL OR SPRING SEMESTER
to include any compelling reason(s) for this preference. Please note that this preference is not guaranteed but rather considered in the process of evaluating and balancing independent study projects per semester.

I would prefer to do the project during the **fall semester** for a few reasons. 

As detailed above, this independent study is part of a much larger project, hence, time is of the essence. Just a week ago, the largest few water dam in the Monduli district broke through, leaving over 70,000 Maasai without water in the upcoming drought season this winter. Time is of the essence.

During the fall semester, my only commitments are my grades and college applications. However, robotics building and competitions take a lot of my time during the first 2 months of spring semester, with all of my time after school and weekends being devoted to placement in qualifiers. Later in my spring semester, I will be busy with AP exam preparation and will also have less time to focus on my independent study.
