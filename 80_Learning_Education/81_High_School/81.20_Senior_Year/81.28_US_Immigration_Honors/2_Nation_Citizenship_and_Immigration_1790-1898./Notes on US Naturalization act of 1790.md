The "Naturalization Act of 1790" was the first federal law in the United States that ==established the criteria for foreign-born individuals to become citizens, essentially limiting citizenship to "free white persons" who had resided in the country for at least two years and demonstrated good character, effectively excluding non-white individuals from citizenship at the time==. 

Key points about the 1790 Naturalization Act:

- **Restricted access:** Only "free white persons" could become naturalized citizens under this act. 
- **Residency requirement:** Applicants needed to have lived in the U.S. for at least two years. 
- **Good character clause:** Individuals had to demonstrate good character to be eligible for citizenship. 
- **Children of citizens:** Children of naturalized citizens under 21 were also considered citizens. 

Historical significance:

- **Early immigration law:**
    
    This act marked the first time the U.S. government set clear guidelines for naturalization. 
    
- **Racial discrimination:**
    
    The "free white person" clause embedded racial restrictions into the law, which were not removed until 1952.

	•	Excluded women, nonwhite persons, indentured servants, and others from naturalization.
3.	Process:

Discussion Questions:
	1.	Why do you think Congress limited naturalization to “free white persons” in 1790, and how does this reflect the societal values and power structures of the time?
	2.	What were the legal and societal consequences of creating the category of “aliens ineligible for citizenship”? How did this impact immigrant communities, particularly Asian immigrants?
	3.	How did the Naturalization Act of 1790 establish early exclusions in American society, and how did these exclusions evolve over time?
	4.	What might have been the significance of requiring naturalized citizens to prove their “good character”? How might this requirement have been interpreted differently for various applicants?
	5.	How does the provision that children of naturalized citizens under 21 would automatically gain citizenship compare to modern citizenship laws for immigrant families?
	6.	What lessons can be drawn from the restrictive nature of the Naturalization Act of 1790 regarding inclusivity and equity in citizenship laws today?
	7.	The racial restrictions of the Naturalization Act were not fully eliminated until 1952. What does this timeline suggest about the evolution of American immigration policy?
	8.	How might the exclusion of women, indentured servants, and other nonwhite persons from naturalization have shaped the social and economic dynamics of early America?
