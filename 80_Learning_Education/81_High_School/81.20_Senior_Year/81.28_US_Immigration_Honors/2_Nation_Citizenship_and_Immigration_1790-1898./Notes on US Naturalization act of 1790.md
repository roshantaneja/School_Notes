The "Naturalization Act of 1790" was the first federal law in the United States that ==established the criteria for foreign-born individuals to become citizens, essentially limiting citizenship to "free white persons" who had resided in the country for at least two years and demonstrated good character, effectively excluding non-white individuals from citizenship at the time==. 

Key points about the 1790 Naturalization Act:

- **Restricted access:** Only "free white persons" could become naturalized citizens under this act. 
- **Residency requirement:** Applicants needed to have lived in the U.S. for at least two years. 
- **Good character clause:** Individuals had to demonstrate good character to be eligible for citizenship. 
- **Children of citizens:** Children of naturalized citizens under 21 were also considered citizens. 

Historical significance:

- **Early immigration law:**
    
    This act marked the first time the U.S. government set clear guidelines for naturalization. 
    
- **Racial discrimination:**
    
    The "free white person" clause embedded racial restrictions into the law, which were not removed until 1952.


Notes on the Naturalization Act of 1790:
1.	Significance:
	•	First U.S. law to define eligibility for citizenship through naturalization.
	•	Established procedures for how immigrants could become U.S. citizens.
2.	Eligibility:
	•	Restricted naturalization to “free white persons” of “good character.”
	•	Applicants needed to reside in the U.S. for two years and in a particular state for one year.
	•	Excluded women, nonwhite persons, indentured servants, and others from naturalization.
3.	Process:
	•	Applicants had to apply to a common law court of record.
	•	They had to prove their good character and take an oath to support the U.S. Constitution.
	•	The court recorded applications and proceedings.
4.	Inheritance of Citizenship:
	•	Children under 21 of naturalized citizens were also granted citizenship.
	•	Children born to U.S. citizens outside the U.S. were considered natural-born citizens.
	•	Citizenship did not descend to persons whose fathers had never resided in the U.S.
5.	Exclusions and Impact:
	•	Created a legal category of “aliens ineligible for citizenship,” affecting Asian immigrants significantly.
	•	Noncitizens faced restrictions on property ownership, public employment, voting, and legal representation.
	•	Racial restrictions were not fully removed until 1952.

Discussion Questions:
	1.	Why do you think Congress limited naturalization to “free white persons” in 1790, and how does this reflect the societal values and power structures of the time?
	2.	What were the legal and societal consequences of creating the category of “aliens ineligible for citizenship”? How did this impact immigrant communities, particularly Asian immigrants?
	3.	How did the Naturalization Act of 1790 establish early exclusions in American society, and how did these exclusions evolve over time?
	4.	What might have been the significance of requiring naturalized citizens to prove their “good character”? How might this requirement have been interpreted differently for various applicants?
	5.	How does the provision that children of naturalized citizens under 21 would automatically gain citizenship compare to modern citizenship laws for immigrant families?
	6.	What lessons can be drawn from the restrictive nature of the Naturalization Act of 1790 regarding inclusivity and equity in citizenship laws today?
	7.	The racial restrictions of the Naturalization Act were not fully eliminated until 1952. What does this timeline suggest about the evolution of American immigration policy?
	8.	How might the exclusion of women, indentured servants, and other nonwhite persons from naturalization have shaped the social and economic dynamics of early America?


**Notes on Benjamin Franklin’s Observations Concerning the Increase of Mankind (1751):**

1. **Purpose and Context**:

• Franklin wrote the essay to address the economic and population growth of the American colonies.

• Prompted by the British Iron Act of 1750, which restricted industrial development in the colonies, Franklin highlighted how these policies stifled colonial growth.

2. **Publication and Influence**:

• Initially written in 1751, the essay was circulated privately and eventually published in 1755 as part of William Clarke’s _Observations_.

• Influential in shaping English economic thought; referenced by Thomas Malthus, Francis Place, and Adam Smith.

3. **Key Ideas on Population Growth**:

• Population increases when marriage is encouraged, which happens when families can be easily supported.

• America’s abundant and cheap land fostered early and frequent marriages, resulting in rapid population growth.

• Franklin estimated the population of the colonies would double every 20-25 years, contrasting with Europe’s slower growth due to scarcity of land and resources.

4. **Economic Observations**:

• Cities and fully settled countries, like those in Europe, faced slower population growth because of limited opportunities, high costs of living, and delayed marriages.

• The colonies’ vast land and economic opportunities encouraged independence and prosperity, unlike the dependence on wage labor in Europe.

• Franklin argued against the use of slaves, pointing out the inefficiencies and costs of slave labor compared to free labor.

5. **Colonial Growth and British Interests**:

• Franklin viewed the colonies as an economic asset to Britain, providing a growing market for British goods.

• He warned Britain against over-restricting colonial industry, as it could weaken both the colonies and the empire.

6. **Critique of Immigration and Slavery**:

• Franklin expressed concerns about non-English immigrants (e.g., Germans in Pennsylvania) and the influence of foreign customs.

• Criticized the reliance on slavery, emphasizing its negative social and economic impacts, including the decline of white labor and productivity.

7. **Philosophical and Social Observations**:

• Franklin argued that governments and policies should encourage population growth by fostering economic opportunity and stability.

• He linked population growth to national strength and advocated for policies that supported marriage, trade, and efficient land use.

8. **Cultural Views**:

• Franklin emphasized the importance of English cultural dominance in the colonies, expressing biases against non-English settlers and people of non-European descent.

• He expressed a preference for “purely white” populations, reflecting the racial attitudes of his time.

  

**Discussion Questions:**

1. How did Franklin connect population growth to economic prosperity in the American colonies? What factors did he identify as key to this growth?

2. What were Franklin’s critiques of slavery, and how did he argue it impacted the colonies economically and socially?

3. Franklin expressed concerns about immigration and cultural assimilation in the colonies. How do these views reflect the broader attitudes of 18th-century America?

4. In what ways did Franklin’s essay advocate for the colonies’ economic independence from Britain, despite framing them as a benefit to the empire?

5. How does Franklin’s observation about population doubling every 20-25 years compare to modern demographic studies? What might account for these differences?

6. How did Franklin’s arguments about the relationship between land availability, marriage, and population growth challenge European views on economics and settlement?

7. What can Franklin’s biases, particularly regarding race and immigration, tell us about the values and limitations of Enlightenment thinking in colonial America?

8. How does Franklin’s critique of restrictive British policies, such as the Iron Act, foreshadow the growing tensions between the colonies and Britain?
