1. **What did you notice?**

* The article challenges the stereotype that Chinese immigrants in 19th-century California were passive victims of discrimination. Instead, it presents a narrative of active resistance through legal action, social organization, and direct confrontation.

* Discrimination against Chinese immigrants was both systemic (laws, taxes, exclusion policies) and societal (violence, harassment, boycotts).

* The response of Chinese immigrants was multifaceted: they formed protective social organizations, pursued legal battles, built autonomous communities, protested through the press, and at times, even resorted to direct confrontation.

* There were both victories and losses—some legal challenges were successful, while exclusionary policies continued well into the 20th century.

  

2. **What kinds of discrimination did Chinese immigrants face?**

* **Legal Discrimination:**

* Laws targeting Chinese immigrants specifically (e.g., Foreign Miners’ Tax, Alien Land Laws, Chinese Exclusion Act).

* Denied U.S. citizenship and the right to testify against white Americans in court.

* Immigration restrictions barring new Chinese arrivals.

* Prohibition from owning land or businesses outright.

* **Economic Discrimination:**

* Employers used Chinese workers for lower wages, leading to hostility from white laborers.

* Organized boycotts and strikes targeted Chinese-owned businesses.

* **Social & Racial Discrimination:**

* Segregation into Chinatowns, often perceived as dangerous or undesirable areas.

* General harassment, including children encouraged to throw stones at Chinese men.

* **Violence & Harassment:**

* Frequent arson attacks on Chinese communities.

* Physical violence, including mob attacks and individual assaults.

* Local governments often failed to protect Chinese residents, sometimes even facilitating their expulsion.

  

3. **How did they resist specific kinds of discrimination?**

* **Legal Resistance:**

* Challenged discriminatory laws in court (e.g., Lin Sing v. Washburn successfully overturned an unfair poll tax).

* Hired legal advocates like Frederick Bee to fight against anti-Chinese policies.

* **Social Organization:**

* Established district associations and the **Chinese Six Companies**, which provided legal, financial, and social support.

* Created self-sufficient Chinatowns for protection and mutual aid.

* **Economic Strategies:**

* Found legal loopholes to continue owning businesses and land by using white intermediaries.

* Organized strikes, like the San Jose laundry workers who refused to work after anti-Chinese legislation.

* **Direct Confrontation:**

* Protested in newspapers to counter anti-Chinese rhetoric.

* Armed themselves in certain situations, as seen in Truckee’s Misery Whip site, where archaeological evidence showed they carried firearms.

* Engaged in violent resistance when necessary, such as the case of Chinese workers attacking a constable attempting to arrest one of their own.

  

4. **What do you think the point of resistance was?**

* The goal of resistance was **survival, dignity, and autonomy** in a society that actively sought to exclude and exploit Chinese immigrants.

* By forming strong community networks and fighting legal battles, they aimed to **retain a foothold in America despite systemic efforts to push them out**.

* Resistance was also about **challenging the perception of Chinese immigrants as passive and defenseless**—they fought back through every available avenue, demonstrating resilience and agency.

* On a broader level, their resistance laid the groundwork for later civil rights movements and helped shape the fight against racial discrimination in the U.S.
