> [!Note] Instructions
> You are to compose 10 clusters of sophisticated sentences (about three sentences each), each cluster including one relative clause.  Remember that each cluster should focus on some aspect of the theme from "Great Expectations" that interests you. Each cluster is a discrete nugget in and of itself; your clusters will not be considered sequentially.
   Features expected:
> 1) a variety of relative pronouns used so as to demonstrate understanding of difference between essential and non-essential; who and whom; proper use of that as an option.
> 2) use of participial phrases, appositives, adjective phrases
> 3) at least three nominative absolutes emboldened or underlined
> 4) at least one instance of inversion somehow labeled
> 5) two instances of the subjunctive as learned from the document somehow labeled
> 6) correct insertion of commas as learned from the document.
> 
> Your sentences will be evaluated on grammatical correctness and syntactical sophistication and stylistic panache. I expect to be impressed by precision, incisiveness, cogency, dynamism.
> 
> By the end of the period, submit yr sentences to Sch in the usual manner (pdf or Word doc -- not Google-doc nor anything fancy).



1. **The wind blowing about the tombstones**, where Pip first encountered the convict, reminded him of the harshness of life that shaped his destiny. Miss Havisham, _who was trapped in her decaying mansion like a ghost of her own making_, became a symbol of unfulfilled desires. Had Pip never met her, _his future would have been_ entirely different. _(subjunctive)_

2. Pip, _who had grown up believing in the value of wealth_, found himself trapped in the expectations society placed on him. The guilt, gnawing at his conscience like a relentless predator, **steering him further from his humble beginnings**, ultimately shaped the man he would become. _(Possible Inversion: “Steering him further from his humble beginnings was the guilt…”)_

3. Estella, **her cold demeanor unwavering**, stood before Pip like an unattainable ideal, a woman _whom he longed to possess yet could never truly reach_. _Were she to soften her heart_, their fates might have intertwined more kindly. _(subjunctive)_

4. The firelight flickered in Miss Havisham’s dimly lit room, _which had not seen joy for decades_. _Its oppressive atmosphere suffocating_, the house served as a physical manifestation of her inner torment. Pip, **his heart still hopeful**, remained oblivious to the full extent of her misery.

5. The convict, _whom Pip had once feared_, eventually became the benefactor _who changed his life forever_. **The iron cuff rattling in the mist**, Pip could not forget the memory of that fateful encounter on the marsh.

6. Pip’s transformation, **the boy from the forge no longer recognizable**, became the crux of his internal struggle. Joe, _whose unwavering loyalty grounded Pip_, remained a symbol of the life _that Pip had forsaken_ in pursuit of a false ideal. The chasm between them widened as Pip’s ambitions soared.

7. London, **with its chaotic streets bustling with life**, contrasted starkly with the quiet simplicity of Pip’s childhood home. He wandered through the city, _which glittered with the promise of fortune_, unaware of how much it would cost him. **His ambition swelling within him**, Pip sought to climb higher, forsaking those who loved him most.

8. **The stars flickering in the night sky**, Pip looked out from his room, thinking of Estella, _who had always been beyond his reach_. His longing, **a flame that refused to die**, only grew stronger the more distant she became.

9. Miss Havisham, _whose grief consumed her, had transformed her home into a tomb of memories. _Her wedding dress yellowed with age_; she waited in vain for a day that would never come. Pip, **his heart heavy**, could only watch as she withered away.

10. Magwitch's unexpected presence revealed himself as the benefactor _who had orchestrated Pip’s rise to wealth_. Turning Pip’s world upside down, the revelation destroyed his illusions of becoming a gentleman by his merit. From that moment, Pip knew he could no longer escape the convict’s influence on his life.
