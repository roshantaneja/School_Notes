[Using the "Books and Coffee" edition of the book for page numbers]
[Additional Note: I started with your Model paragraph to get an understanding of how to write the essay. Nonetheless, while I have retained the structure, I have tried to reduce the chirality to your original Frankenstein Essay.]

Once Winston betrays Julia in the Ministry of Love, the Thought Police, having cleansed him of any chance of rebellion, solidifies its control over his mind and spirit. Up until this point in the book, despite Winston's covert acts of defiance, such as his affair with a member of the "Junior Anti-Sex League" or his writings on overthrowing the party, he had maintained hope that he might retain his cover as a casual party member. But this final act of betrayal, to ask that Julia be tortured rather than him, triggered by the fear instilled in him by the party, plunges him into a state of complete surrender, a surrender wholly caused by the Party's all-powerfull-ness. Mr O'Brien, who had already swindled Winston into confessing his crimes, interprets Winston’s desperate cry, “Do it to Julia! Not me!” as a confirmation of the Party’s absolute power over the individual’s thoughts and emotions ().
