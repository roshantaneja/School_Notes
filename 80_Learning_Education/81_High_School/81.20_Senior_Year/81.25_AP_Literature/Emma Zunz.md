Jorge Luis Borges’ short story _Emma Zunz_ is a fascinating study in character development through plot. Here are some key aspects to consider as you read and annotate:

  

**1. The Role of the Plot in Character Development**

• Borges carefully constructs the narrative so that Emma’s transformation is revealed through her actions rather than her inner thoughts. Pay attention to how her emotions—grief, rage, and resolve—evolve as the plot unfolds.

• The structure of the story mimics a detective or revenge tale, but Borges subverts these genres by making Emma’s motivations complex and ambiguous.

  

**2. Emma’s Emotional Journey**

• **Before the Crime**: The story begins with Emma receiving a letter about her father’s death. How does Borges describe her reaction? Is she numb, furious, or methodical? Consider how her emotions drive her to act.

• **The Execution of Her Plan**: Look at the precise way Emma carries out her revenge. Borges doesn’t give us direct access to her thoughts—what does this omission tell us about her character?

• **Aftermath and Justification**: By the end of the story, Emma fully believes in the truth of the narrative she has created. How does Borges show the shift from premeditated vengeance to self-conviction?

  

**3. Narrative Structure and Perspective**

• Borges’ third-person omniscient narrator reports Emma’s actions without deeply exploring her psyche. How does this affect our understanding of her?

• The narration seems to blur fact and fiction—does Emma manipulate herself into believing her own lie? Or does Borges suggest that perceived justice is more powerful than objective truth?

  

**4. Gender and Power**

• How does Emma use societal perceptions of femininity to execute her plan?

• In what ways does Borges explore gendered expectations, particularly in Emma’s ability to control and manipulate the narrative?

  

**Key Passages to Analyze**

• The moment Emma reads the letter and her immediate reaction.

• The scene in which she visits the sailor—how is this described, and what emotions are conveyed through Borges’ language?

• The final lines—what do they reveal about Emma’s state of mind?

  

**Final Thought**

  

Borges constructs _Emma Zunz_ as a tightly woven narrative where action and perception shape identity. Emma’s transformation is not just about avenging her father—it’s about reconstructing her own sense of reality.

For class discussion, think about whether Emma is truly in control of her fate or whether she becomes a victim of her own deception. Also, consider Borges’ message about justice—does the truth matter if the narrative is convincing enough.

  

**1. The Nature of Truth and Lies**

• Emma convinces herself of a fabricated narrative by the end of the story. Does Borges suggest that personal truth can be more powerful than objective reality? If so, what implications does this have for justice?

• At what point does Emma stop lying and start believing in the story she tells? Or does she ever truly believe it?

  

**2. Justice vs. Vengeance**

• Borges never directly states whether Emma’s act of revenge is justified. Does the reader feel a sense of catharsis, or does her act feel hollow? Why?

• What distinguishes justice from vengeance in this story? Is Emma’s action an attempt at moral justice, or is it simply a personal reckoning?

  

**3. Power and Manipulation**

• Emma leverages societal perceptions of femininity, victimhood, and innocence to execute her plan. Is her ability to manipulate others a sign of empowerment or a symptom of her oppression?

• If Emma had sought a more traditional form of justice (like reporting her father’s former boss), do you think she would have been successful? Why or why not?

  

**4. The Role of the Reader in Emma’s Story**

• Borges withholds Emma’s direct thoughts, only giving us her actions. Does this lack of access make her feel more distant, or does it force us to become complicit in her reasoning?

• By the end of the story, do you sympathize with Emma? Why or why not? How does Borges influence your perception of her?

  

**5. The Interplay of Memory and Trauma**

• How does Emma’s trauma shape the way she constructs her version of events? Does her revenge act as a form of closure, or does it only deepen her suffering?

• The story hints that Emma might be repressing certain aspects of her emotions. Are there moments where Borges subtly reveals this repression?

  

**6. The Unusual Narrative Structure**

• Borges often plays with genre—does _Emma Zunz_ feel like a detective story, a psychological thriller, or something else entirely?

• How does the story’s detached, almost clinical tone impact your emotional engagement with Emma?

  

**7. Borges’ View on Human Nature**

• Does Borges suggest that all humans, when pushed to extremes, are capable of rewriting their own reality? If so, what does this imply about self-deception and morality?

• If another character had told this story instead of an omniscient narrator, how might our perception of Emma and her actions change?

  

**8. The Meaning of the Final Sentence**

• The last line states: _“The story was unbelievable, indeed, but it impressed everyone because, substantially, it was true.”_

• What does Borges mean by this? What is the difference between something being factually true and something being _substantially_ true?

These questions encourage both literary analysis and personal introspection, challenging the reader to rethink truth, morality, and justice in _Emma Zunz_. Which one do you find the most compelling?
