Analyzing Bias in Media

Objective:
To identify and analyze instances of bias in popular media and understand how bias can influence perception and narrative construction.

Instructions:
1. Select a piece of popular media (e.g., a news article, a TV show episode, a movie, a song, a social media post, etc.) that addresses a current event or a social issue.

2. Watch, read, or listen to the piece carefully, paying close attention to details, language, and framing.

3. Write a 2-3 paragraph response that addresses the following:
	* Summarize the media piece and its main message or argument.
	* Identify at least two instances of bias (from the codex) within the media piece. This could include bias in language, imagery, selection of sources, framing of the issue, or omission of relevant information.
	* Explain how these instances of bias influence the overall message or narrative of the media piece.
	* Reflect on how recognizing bias in media can help viewers/readers become more critical consumers of information.
