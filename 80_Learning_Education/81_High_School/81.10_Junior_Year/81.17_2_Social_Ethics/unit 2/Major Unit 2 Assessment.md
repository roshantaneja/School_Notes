**The Issue:** Children of undocumented immigrants, even if they are U.S. citizens themselves, face a heightened risk of entering the child welfare system after the detention or deportation of a parent. This can be due to several factors, including:

- **Loss of parental care:** When a parent is detained or deported, children may be left without proper supervision or care, triggering child welfare intervention.
- **Fear of deportation:** Undocumented family members may be reluctant to seek help from authorities due to fear of their own deportation, leaving children vulnerable in unsafe situations.
- **Lack of resources:** The loss of a parent's income and support system can create financial hardship, making it difficult to provide for basic needs, which can be seen as neglect by child welfare.

**Real-Life Stories:**

1. **Anayeli Batista:** Anayeli, a U.S. citizen teenager, was placed in foster care after her undocumented father was detained by ICE. Despite having a stable home with her mother and siblings, authorities removed her due to concerns about the single-parent household's ability to care for her ([SOURCE undocumented children in foster care ON American Immigration Council americanimmigrationcouncil.org]). This case highlights the systemic bias that can view single-parent households led by non-citizens as inadequate, even when demonstrably safe and loving.
    
2. **Carlos and Marco Hernandez:** Brothers Carlos (10) and Marco (8) were U.S. citizens living with their undocumented mother. When their mother was deported, they were placed in separate foster homes. The boys experienced emotional distress from the separation and struggled to adjust to their new environments. This story ([SOURCE us citizen children impacted by immigration enforcement ON American Immigration Council americanimmigrationcouncil.org]) illustrates the psychological trauma children can experience due to family separation caused by immigration enforcement.
    

**Impact of Systemic Oppression:**

These stories showcase the impact of systemic oppression on children of undocumented immigrants. The fear of deportation creates a chilling effect, preventing families from accessing essential services and leaving them vulnerable. Additionally, biases within the child welfare system can lead to unnecessary removal of children from safe homes, causing further trauma.

**Internalized Oppression:**

Children in these situations may also experience internalized oppression. The constant fear and uncertainty surrounding their immigration status can lead to feelings of isolation, worthlessness, and a sense that they don't belong. This can have long-lasting negative consequences on their mental health and well-being.

Understanding these real-life stories helps us see the human cost of immigration enforcement policies and the need for reforms that prioritize the safety and well-being of children.\\\
