### Too Much Information

#### Confirmation Bias
**Definition:** The tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that confirms one's preexisting beliefs or hypotheses.

**Examples:**
- A person believing in a particular diet's effectiveness might only notice stories of success and ignore evidence of the diet's potential health risks.
- An investor might give more weight to financial news that supports their decision to buy a particular stock, while disregarding negative reports about the company.

#### Illusory Correlation
**Definition:** The perception of a relationship between two variables even when no such relationship exists.

**Examples:**
- Believing that ice cream sales cause shark attacks because both increase in the summer.
- Assuming that wearing a particular color of clothing is lucky because of a few coincidental successes experienced while wearing it.

#### In-group Bias
**Definition:** The tendency to favor one's own group, whether it's based on race, gender, nationality, or even favorite sports teams.

**Examples:**
- Preferring a job candidate who graduated from the same university as you, despite another candidate having more relevant experience.
- Believing that the achievements of your country’s athletes are due to talent and hard work, but attributing the achievements of athletes from other countries to unfair advantages or cheating.

### Not Enough Meaning

#### Fundamental Attribution Error
**Definition:** The tendency to overemphasize personality-based explanations for behaviors observed in others while underemphasizing the role and power of situational influences.

**Examples:**
- Assuming a coworker is lazy because they missed a deadline, without considering external factors like illness or family issues.
- Judging a stranger as rude for not holding the door open, without acknowledging they might not have seen you.

#### Illusion of Control

**Examples:**

**Examples:**
- Assuming someone is not tech-savvy because of their age.
- Believing all members of a particular nationality behave in the same way or have the same beliefs.

### Need to Act Fast

#### Bandwagon Effect
**Definition:** The tendency to do (or believe) things because many other people do (or believe) the same.

**Examples:**
- Buying a product because it’s trending, even if you don’t need it.
- Changing your favorite team because it’s winning and popular among your friends.

#### Groupthink
**Definition:** The practice of thinking or making decisions as a group in a way that discourages creativity or individual responsibility.

**Examples:**
- A team deciding not to pursue an innovative solution because they fear it will disrupt harmony within the group.
- A jury quickly reaching a consensus to avoid conflict, despite some members having doubts.

#### Status Quo Bias
**Definition:** The preference to keep things the same by doing nothing or by sticking with a decision made previously.

**Examples:**
- Continuing to invest in a poorly performing fund because it’s easier than researching new options.
- Staying in a job you don’t like because you're used to it and changing seems too difficult.

### What Should We Remember

#### Recency Bias
**Definition:** The tendency to weigh the latest information more heavily than older data.

**Examples:**
- Judging a long-term employee's performance based on the past few months rather than their entire tenure.
- Investing in a stock because it has been rising recently, ignoring its long-term performance history.

#### Self-Serving Bias
**Definition:** The common habit of a person taking credit for positive events or outcomes, but blaming outside factors for negative events.

**Examples:**
- A student attributing their good grades to their intelligence and hard work, but blaming the teacher for poor grades.
- A manager taking credit for a project’s success but blaming the team for any failures.

#### Hindsight Bias
**Definition:** The tendency to see events that have already occurred as being more predictable than they were before they took place.

**Examples:**
- After an election, claiming that you knew who was going to win all along.
- Believing that the success of a tech company was obvious from the start, ignoring the uncertainties and challenges it faced in its early days.
