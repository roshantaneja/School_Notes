What SPECIFICALLY needs to be done?


**PART I.** (40 points) Prothero Questions Response: Throughout the semester we have used a four-part approach to the various world religions.  We saw that each religion articulates a problem, a solution or goal, a technique or techniques for moving from the problem to the goal, and exemplars that show us the path from the problem to the goal. You will write a four paragraph essay in which you identify and explain your religious “Way” – one paragraph on each of Prothero’s four steps.  Do not just answer “My four steps are… ”; rather, write deep and thoughtful paragraphs that demonstrate critical thinking and genuine personal reflection. 


1. Problem: What is wrong with the world? What is awry with our lives? What sickness are we suffering from? What are some specific examples that serve as evidence of sickness? (10 pts)

2. Goal: What is the solution to the problem?  What is our religious goal in life?  What is the prescribed treatment for our sickness? (10 pts)

3. Techniques: How do we move from our problem to our goal?  How do we achieve our religious goals?  How do we heal ourselves/the world from this problem/sickness? (10 pts)

4. Exemplars: Who has walked this path before?  Whose life can serve as a model for us?  Who has healed themselves of this sickness? Give a specific example from this person’s life. (10 pts)


**PART II.** (60 points) Specific “Your Way” Questions Response: Structure this part of your paper to address the 6 topics listed below.  Try to convince me that your Way is The Way! 


1. Give your religion a name that fits: Giving the religion a name will take some thought as you will want a name that will get attention and yet not alienate potential converts.   For example, “Islam: the way of submission” (5 pts)


2. Answer some of life’s big questions: 
      * Is there a God, many gods, no god? 
      * Where do we come from and what happens after we die? 
      * How do your beliefs deal with the problems of suffering and evil in the world? (10 pts)


3. Sacred text: Give a sample of the most important passages of your sacred writings. Create one that will inspire your believers in following the beliefs and practices of your religion. (10 pts)


4. Overcoming specific contemporary problems: Identify two of the most urgent problems currently facing humanity and explain how following your religion can address and resolve these issues.      (10 pts)


5. Description of the ideal world: Suppose that everyone in the world converted to your religion – what would the world be like? How would it be different from the way it is now? (10 pts)


6. Symbol and Ritual: Develop at least one symbol and one ritual that represent your beliefs and practices. (15 pts)
