Over 4 million students in the United States in both public and private schools are children of undocumented immigrants. For decades now, Americans have been passively witnessing the horrors that are occurring to children of undocumented immigrants. These children occupy a precarious position. Often unseen and unheard by the broader society, their lives are deeply affected by immigration policies and societal attitudes. Even though many of these children are U.S. citizens by birth, they are disproportionately at risk of entering the child welfare system. The threat of family separation hangs heavy, casting a long shadow over their sense of security—furthermore, these separations subject children to a complex web of systemic and internalized oppression.

I became acutely aware of the issues surrounding the children of undocumented immigrants in middle school when one of my good friend's parents was deported. Over the next year, her attendance in school started to worsen until seeing her at school was rare. Within the year, she was moved to a foster home elsewhere in California, and I haven't heard from her since.

My story isn't a unique one. Even as U.S. citizens themselves, these children are at elevated risk of entering the child welfare system when a parent is detained or deported. Real-life stories illustrate these struggles. Anayeli Batista, a US citizen teenager, was placed in foster care after U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detained her undocumented father. Despite having a stable home with her mother and siblings, authorities removed her from her mother's care and placed her in the child welfare system. This case highlights the systemic bias that can view single-parent households led by non-citizens as inadequate, even when demonstrably safe and loving.

Carlos and Marco Hernandez: Brothers Carlos (10) and Marco (8) were U.S. citizens living with their undocumented mother. When their mother was deported, they were placed in separate foster homes. The boys experienced emotional distress from the separation and struggled to adjust to their new environments. This story illustrates the psychological trauma children can experience due to family separation caused by immigration enforcement. It extends beyond direct actions to a chilling effect discouraging families from seeking essential services.

Systemic oppression manifests in immigration policies that rip families apart, leaving lasting scars on children. On March 19th, just a month ago, the US Supreme Court passed SB4, which allows any Texas law enforcement officer to stop and deport anyone anywhere in the state if they perceive them to be in the US illegally. This allows even more oppression of both immigrants and their children. The “chilling effect” discourages entire communities from accessing services or reporting crimes. These issues can change through systemic reform of our immigration laws.

The power to transform adversity into hope lies within us. Let us advocate for reformative and preventative (e.g., abolishing SB4) policies that uplift these children and embrace them as valued members of our communities. Through unwavering commitment to justice and empathy, we can illuminate a path towards a future where every child thrives, not just survives.
