Cardell Morant
United States Congress
Washington, D.C. 20515

Dear Cardell Morant,

I write with a strong sense of urgency and empathy, speaking out for the rights of the children of undocumented immigrants in this country. Four million students in the public and private school systems in the United States are children of undocumented immigrants (“Fact Sheet”). Americans have apathetically looked on for far too long at the atrocities that happen to these children, who walk a very steep slope, one that keeps them unseen and unheard by the rest of society. Though many of them are U.S. citizens by birth, they are disproportionately more likely to be included in the child welfare system, where, at every turn, the looming threat of family separation overshadows their sense of security (“Immigration Service”). The Child Welfare system in the United States needs to evolve to support the lives and rights of children of undocumented immigrants.

I became acutely aware of the issues surrounding the children of undocumented immigrants in middle school when one of my good friend's parents was deported. Her name was Sofia, and I used to eat lunch with her all of the time. She told me one day that her father was deported back to Mexico, and she was living with her cousin and aunt. Over the next year, her attendance in school started to diminish until seeing her at school was rare. Within the year, she was moved to a foster home elsewhere in California, and I haven't heard from her since. Her story is hardly unique. Even as U.S. citizens, children of undocumented immigrants are at elevated risk of entering the child welfare system when a parent is detained or deported. 

Sometimes, Implicit bias against single-parent households can cause unbalanced seizure of children. For instance, Anayeli Batista, a U.S. citizen teenager, had to enter foster care after her undocumented father was taken into custody by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Even though Anayeli lived comfortably at home with her mother and siblings, authorities took Anayeli from her mother. They placed her in the child welfare system (Strangers No Longer: Together on a Journey of Hope). This case brings up the systemic bias that can view the single-parent household led by non-citizens as inadequate, even when demonstrably safe and loving (Implicit Bias and Decision-Making).

Carlos and Marco Hernandez: Brothers Carlos (10) and Marco (8) were U.S. citizens living with their undocumented mother. When their mother was deported, they were placed in separate foster homes. The boys experienced emotional distress from the separation and struggled to adjust to their new environments (Hernandez, Marco). These situations demonstrate the psychological trauma children can experience due to family separation caused by immigration enforcement (Cohen George). It extends beyond direct actions to a chilling effect discouraging families from seeking essential services like law enforcement or medical services. This chilling effect is dangerous to legal citizens and also encourages crime. Crime rates in cities with large populations of undocumented citizens like San Diego, Los Angeles, Houston, and Dallas have seen increased crime rates since ICE operations began within city limits (“Undocumented Americans.”).

These immigration policies rip families apart, leaving lasting scars on children. In 2007, there were an estimated 11.9 million undocumented immigrants, nearly half of whom had custody of children(“Fact Sheet”). In that year alone, over 300,000 undocumented immigrants were deported from the United States (“US Citizens Impacted by Immigration Enforcement”). This means over 150,000 children of undocumented immigrants lost either one or both parents. They were removed from the child welfare system, where many still reside today.

The cost of maintaining the child welfare system is not cheap. State child welfare systems spent about $31.4 billion on child welfare in 2020 (The Child Welfare System: Strategies For Reform). The states of California, Texas, New York, Florida, Illinois, and New Jersey alone consumed nearly 80% of that budget. 12.8% of children in the child welfare system are children of undocumented immigrants (“Fact Sheet”). A vast portion of our budget spent on Child Welfare is spent on children of undocumented immigrants. 

One proposed solution to cut down on this overinflated budget is to allow undocumented parents to bring their children with them and keep custody of them as they are deported. These stances are extreme and don’t provide support to families who are seeking asylum or have extenuating circumstances (Rubac, Gloria). However, that doesn't solve many of the underlying issues. Many of these Child Welfare programs are problematic. Many Child Welfare officials have implicit biases that often result in unbalanced seizure of children from lower-income single-parent families, especially after one parent is deported (Implicit Bias and Decision-Making). One such example is Anayeli mentioned above. Other problems include unwarranted family separation, like the Hernandez family. These recurring problems stem from untrained officers and limited oversight and reporting. There are many more ways to solve this problem, starting with reforming the Child Welfare system. Therefore, I urge you to take the following actions:

1. **Implement Mandatory Bias Training for Child Welfare Professionals:** Mandate comprehensive training programs to identify and mitigate implicit bias within the child welfare system. Educating those on the front lines about the influence of racial and economic biases in their decision-making processes is crucial (“OACAS Library Guides: Equity and Anti-Oppression in Child Welfare: Bias”).
2. **Support and Fund Community-Based Initiatives:** Encourage local governments and non-profits to develop community-based programs that support families of color and those from low-income backgrounds. These programs should prevent unnecessary separations and provide support tailored to these communities' needs.
3. **Legislate for Enhanced Monitoring and Reporting of Bias:** Pass legislation requiring child welfare agencies to regularly report on the racial and economic demographics of the families they serve and their outcomes. This transparency would help identify disparities and prompt necessary reforms (“Report Disproportionality and Race Equity in Child Welfare.”)
4. **Promote Public Awareness Campaigns:** Launch campaigns to raise public awareness about the prevalence and impacts of bias in the child welfare system. Highlight personal stories and data to engage the community and foster empathy and understanding.
5. **Establish an Independent Oversight Committee:** Form an independent committee to oversee child welfare cases involving racial and economic biases, check systemic issues, and ensure fair treatment across all instances (Race and Poverty Bias in the Child Welfare System: Strategies For Reform).
6. **Legislate For the Rights of Deported Persons:** Provide a legal framework for undocumented immigrants to maintain custody of their children in the case that they are removed from the country. 

Congressman Morant’s concern for these vulnerable children is genuine and crucial to the impact of this letter. “Unaccompanied children fleeing violence are among the most vulnerable people seeking refuge in the United States. Our current laws on the books require that these children be screened for human trafficking, housed in child-appropriate settings, and reunified with family in the United States. At the same time, they await their immigration proceedings,” said Morant. “But the tragedy is that these children are still at risk. Congress must ensure the health and safety of these kids—we must do better to protect them.”

Imagine a classroom filled with bright, curious faces. Imagine some of those faces are clouded with worry, hunger, pain, and empty seats. These are the children we are failing. Let us not continue to defer their dreams (Implicit Bias in Child Welfare, Education and Mental Impacts). Let's act compassionately and reform the system to ensure every child feels safe, loved, and empowered to reach their full potential. Congressman Morant, your recent legislation offers a glimmer of hope. Please consider expanding its scope to encompass the needs of all children of undocumented immigrants, not just unaccompanied minors. We cannot afford to wait any longer. Let's act now to protect these vulnerable children. Empathy as our guide allows us to build a future where every child feels safe and valued.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,





Roshan Taneja
