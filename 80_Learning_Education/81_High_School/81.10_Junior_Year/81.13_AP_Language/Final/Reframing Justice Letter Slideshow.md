# Rights of Children of Undocumented Immigrants

By Roshan Taneja

---

## The Urgency

- **4 Million** children in U.S. schools
- **Disproportionate inclusion** in child welfare
- **Family separation** threats

%% Speaker Notes:
I write with a strong sense of urgency and empathy, speaking out for the rights of the children of undocumented immigrants in this country. Four million students in the public and private school systems in the United States are children of undocumented immigrants. Americans have apathetically looked on for far too long at the atrocities that happen to these children, who walk a very steep slope, one that keeps them unseen and unheard by the rest of society. Though many of them are U.S. citizens by birth, they are disproportionately more likely to be included in the child welfare system, where, at every turn, the looming threat of family separation overshadows their sense of security. The Child Welfare system in the United States needs to evolve to support the lives and rights of children of undocumented immigrants.

## Personal Impact

- **Sofia's story**
- **Anayeli Batista's case**

%% Speaker Notes:
I became acutely aware of the issues surrounding the children of undocumented immigrants in middle school when one of my good friend's parents was deported. Her name was Sofia, and I used to eat lunch with her all of the time. She told me one day that her father was deported back to Mexico, and she was living with her cousin and aunt. Over the next year, her attendance in school started to diminish until seeing her at school was rare. Within the year, she was moved to a foster home elsewhere in California, and I haven't heard from her since. Her story is hardly unique. Even as U.S. citizens, children of undocumented immigrants are at elevated risk of entering the child welfare system when a parent is detained or deported.
Implicit bias against single-parent households can cause unbalanced seizure of children. For instance, Anayeli Batista, a U.S. citizen teenager, had to enter foster care after her undocumented father was taken into custody by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Even though Anayeli lived comfortably at home with her mother and siblings, authorities took Anayeli from her mother. They placed her in the child welfare system. This case brings up the systemic bias that can view the single-parent household led by non-citizens as inadequate, even when demonstrably safe and loving.

## Systemic Bias

- **Carlos and Marco Hernandez**
- **Psychological trauma**

%% Speaker Notes:
Carlos and Marco Hernandez: Brothers Carlos (10) and Marco (8) were U.S. citizens living with their undocumented mother. When their mother was deported, they were placed in separate foster homes. The boys experienced emotional distress from the separation and struggled to adjust to their new environments. These situations demonstrate the psychological trauma children can experience due to family separation caused by immigration enforcement. It extends beyond direct actions to a chilling effect discouraging families from seeking essential services like law enforcement or medical services. This chilling effect is dangerous to legal citizens and also encourages crime. Crime rates in cities with large populations of undocumented citizens like San Diego, Los Angeles, Houston, and Dallas have seen increased crime rates since ICE operations began within city limits.

## Financial Burden

- **$31.4 billion** spent on child welfare (2020)
- **12.8%** of children in welfare are of undocumented immigrants

%% Speaker Notes:
The cost of maintaining the child welfare system is not cheap. State child welfare systems spent about $31.4 billion on child welfare in 2020. The states of California, Texas, New York, Florida, Illinois, and New Jersey alone consumed nearly 80% of that budget. 12.8% of children in the child welfare system are children of undocumented immigrants. A vast portion of our budget spent on Child Welfare is spent on children of undocumented immigrants.

## What We Can Do

1. **Raise Awareness**
2. **Support Local Initiatives**
3. **Volunteer and Mentor**

%% Speaker Notes:
1. Raise Awareness: Use social media platforms and school events to highlight the issues faced by children of undocumented immigrants. Sharing personal stories and data can help engage the community and foster empathy and understanding.
2. Support Local Initiatives: Participate in and support community programs that assist families of undocumented immigrants. Encourage local governments and non-profits to develop programs that prevent unnecessary separations and provide tailored support.
3. Volunteer and Mentor: Offer your time to volunteer with organizations that work with children of undocumented immigrants. Mentoring can provide much-needed support and stability for these children, helping them navigate challenges and succeed in their personal and academic lives.

## More Actions

4. **Educate Ourselves and Others**
5. **Advocate for Policy Changes**
6. **Create Safe Spaces**

%% Speaker Notes:
4. Educate Ourselves and Others: Take the time to learn about the challenges faced by children of undocumented immigrants and share this knowledge with peers. Understanding the issues is the first step toward meaningful change.
5. Advocate for Policy Changes: Encourage school boards and local officials to implement policies that support children of undocumented immigrants. This can include providing resources, training staff to handle related issues sensitively, and ensuring a supportive environment.
6. Create Safe Spaces: Foster inclusive environments in schools and communities where children of undocumented immigrants feel safe and valued. This can involve setting up support groups, offering counseling services, and promoting a culture of acceptance and respect.

## Call to Action

- **Support vulnerable children**
- **Promote inclusivity**
- **Act now**

%% Speaker Notes:
Imagine a classroom filled with bright, curious faces. Imagine some of those faces are clouded with worry, hunger, pain, and empty seats. These are the children we are failing. Let us not continue to defer their dreams. Let's act compassionately and reform the system to ensure every child feels safe, loved, and empowered to reach their full potential. We cannot afford to wait any longer. Let's act now to protect these vulnerable children. Empathy as our guide allows us to build a future where every child feels safe and valued.
