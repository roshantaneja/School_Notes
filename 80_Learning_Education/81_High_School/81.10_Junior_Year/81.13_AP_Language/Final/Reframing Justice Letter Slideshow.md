# Rights of Children of Undocumented Immigrants

By Roshan Taneja

note: Speaker Notes:

Hi everyone, I'm here to talk about a serious issue: the rights of children of undocumented immigrants.

---

## The Urgency

- **4 Million** children in U.S. schools
- **Disproportionate inclusion** in child welfare
- **Family separation** threats

note: Speaker Notes:
There are 4 million students in our schools who have undocumented parents. These kids face a lot of problems, and they're often ignored by society. Even though many of them are U.S. citizens, they're more likely to end up in the child welfare system, which means they might be taken away from their families. We need to change how the system works to help these kids.

## Personal Impact

- **Sofia's story**
- **Anayeli Batista's case**
- **Impacts of Implicit Bias**

note: Speaker Notes:
I first noticed this problem in middle school when my friend's dad got deported. Her name was Sofia, and we used to eat lunch together everyday. One day, she told me her dad was sent back to Mexico, and she had to live with her aunt. Over time, she stopped coming to school. Within the year, she was moved to a foster home elsewhere in California, and I haven't heard from her since. Her story is hardly unique. Even as U.S. citizens, children of undocumented immigrants are at elevated risk of entering the child welfare system when a parent is detained or deported.

Implicit bias against single-parent households can cause unbalanced seizure of children. For instance, Anayeli Batista, a U.S. citizen teenager, had to enter foster care after her undocumented father was taken into custody by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Even though Anayeli lived comfortably at home with her mother and siblings, authorities took Anayeli from her mother and placed her in the child welfare system. This case brings up the systemic bias that can view the single-parent household led by non-citizens as inadequate, even when demonstrably safe and loving.

## Systemic Bias

- **Carlos and Marco Hernandez**
- **Chilling Effect**
- **Psychological trauma**

note:
Another example is Carlos and Marco Hernandez, the Brothers were U.S. citizens living with their undocumented mother. When their mother was deported, they were placed in separate foster homes. The boys experienced emotional distress from the separation and struggled to adjust to their new environments. These situations demonstrate the psychological trauma children can experience due to family separation caused by immigration enforcement. It extends beyond direct actions to a chilling effect discouraging families from seeking essential services like law enforcement or medical services. This chilling effect is dangerous to legal citizens and also encourages crime. Crime rates in cities with large populations of undocumented citizens like San Diego, Los Angeles, Houston, and Dallas have seen increased crime rates since ICE operations began within city limits.

## Financial Burden

- **$31.7 billion** spent on child welfare (2020)
- **12.8%** of children in welfare are of undocumented immigrants

%%Cut down on this%%
note:
The cost of maintaining the child welfare system is not cheap. State child welfare systems spent about $31.7 billion on child welfare in 2020. The states of California, Texas, New York, Florida, Illinois, and New Jersey alone consumed nearly 80% of that budget. 12.8% of children in the child welfare system are children of undocumented immigrants. A vast portion of our budget spent on Child Welfare is spent on children of undocumented immigrants.

2. Support Local Initiatives: Participate in and support community programs that assist families of undocumented immigrants. Encourage local governments and non-profits to develop programs that prevent unnecessary separations and provide tailored support.
3. Volunteer and Mentor: Offer your time to volunteer with organizations that work with children of undocumented immigrants. Mentoring can provide much-needed support and stability for these children, helping them navigate challenges and succeed in their personal and academic lives.

note:
Imagine a classroom filled with bright, curious faces. Imagine some of those faces are clouded with worry, hunger, pain, and empty seats. These are the children we are failing.

We cannot afford to wait any longer. Let's act now to protect these vulnerable children. Empathy as our guide allows us to build a future where every child feels safe and valued.
