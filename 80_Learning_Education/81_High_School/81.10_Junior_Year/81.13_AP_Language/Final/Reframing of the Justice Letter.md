### CAT Analysis

**Choices:**
- **Narrative Examples:** The letter uses personal stories (e.g., Sofia, Anayeli Batista, Carlos and Marco Hernandez) to illustrate the real-life impact of current policies, creating an emotional connection with the audience. For example, "Her name was Sofia, and I used to eat lunch with her all of the time."
- **Statistics and Data:** The letter includes statistics to provide a factual basis for the argument, such as, "State child welfare systems spent about $31.4 billion on child welfare in 2020."
- **Specific Legislative Proposals:** The letter outlines detailed action steps, including mandatory bias training, supporting community-based initiatives, and establishing an independent oversight committee. For instance, "Implement Mandatory Bias Training for Child Welfare Professionals."

**Appeals:**
- **Ethos (Credibility):** Roshan Taneja establishes credibility through personal experience and knowledge of the subject, citing relevant sources and legislation. For instance, referencing Congressman Morant's statement, "Unaccompanied children fleeing violence are among the most vulnerable people seeking refuge in the United States."
- **Logos (Logic):** Logical arguments are made through the use of statistics and data, such as the financial cost of the child welfare system and the percentage of children affected, "12.8% of children in the child welfare system are children of undocumented immigrants."
- **Pathos (Emotion):** Emotional appeal is strong, invoking empathy by sharing poignant stories of children affected by these issues. For example, "Imagine some of those faces are clouded with worry, hunger, pain, and empty seats."

**Tone:**
- **Urgent and Empathetic:** The letter opens with a sense of urgency and empathy, "I write with a strong sense of urgency and empathy, speaking out for the rights of the children of undocumented immigrants."
- **Informative and Persuasive:** Throughout, the tone is informative, providing detailed evidence and persuasive arguments, "The cost of maintaining the child welfare system is not cheap. State child welfare systems spent about $31.4 billion on child welfare in 2020."
- **Hopeful and Encouraging:** The conclusion shifts to a hopeful and encouraging tone, urging action, "Imagine a classroom filled with bright, curious faces... Let's act now to protect these vulnerable children."

**Evidence and Commentary:**
- **Evidence:** The letter provides specific examples and data to support the call to action. For instance, "One proposed solution to cut down on this overinflated budget is to allow undocumented parents to bring their children with them and keep custody of them as they are deported."
- **Commentary:** The commentary highlights the urgency and necessity of the proposed actions, connecting them to broader societal impacts and moral imperatives. For example, "Empathy as our guide allows us to build a future where every child feels safe and valued."

By using personal anecdotes, factual data, and specific legislative proposals, the letter effectively builds a compelling case for reforming the child welfare system to better support children of undocumented immigrants. The combination of emotional appeals and logical arguments aims to persuade Congressman Morant to take action on this critical issue.
