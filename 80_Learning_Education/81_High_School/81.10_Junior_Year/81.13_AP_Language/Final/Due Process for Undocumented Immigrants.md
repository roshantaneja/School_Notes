WASHINGTON — President Trump [said on Twitter](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1010900865602019329) this weekend that undocumented immigrants were invaders who “must immediately, with no Judges or Court Cases,” [be sent home](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/24/us/politics/trump-immigration-judges-due-process.html). Mr. Trump’s comments prompted criticism that he wanted the United States to strip immigrants and asylum seekers of due-process rights. He also appeared to ignore the fact that some people who enter the country illegally are already removed from the United States without court hearings.
