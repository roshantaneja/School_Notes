In the “Post-Postscript” of the paperback edition of The Anthropocene Reviewed, John Green writes, “Usually, when I finish a book, it feels very over to me, because once a book is published, it’s no longer really mine. It belongs to the people who will read it, the people who will comingle their own experiences and emotions with the text…. The art and its viewer or reader make meaning together in a collaboration that transcends time and space. My feeling has always been that I make the words, and then leave them to become whatever kind of meaning a reader can find” (276). This assignment is your opportunity to find meaning in one of John Green’s review essays through a one-pager. 

A one-pager is an analytical, creative, and written response to a text that completely fills one side of a piece of paper. Treat this one-pager as a visual representation of your favorite review and your response to it. Which review would you give 5 stars, and why? (Essentially, you get to review the review.)

Required Details

1. Fill the entire page with color and text. There shouldn’t be any blank, white space. 
    
1. (a white background against text is okay.)
    
3. Clearly label each element of your one-pager.
    
4. Include the title of the book, the title of the review, the author, and the number of stars you give the review.  You should try to incorporate this element as creatively as possible. 
    
5. A quote that encapsulates what you loved about the review, and a brief explanation why.
    
6. An image or illustration. You do not have to be a 5-star illustrator to create a 5-star image. You may collage, draw, paint – whatever works to represent your idea with clarity and intentionality.
    
7. Choose three more responses from the following columns: two from the first column, and one from the second. 
    

| Column 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Column 2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

In John Green's book "The Anthropocene Reviewed," the review of Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest serves as a compelling lens through which to examine the complexities of human nature, ambition, and the societal constructs that shape our desires. Green writes, "We are creatures of appetite and ego, and we are desperate to matter, and so we make contests out of consumption." This line struck me profoundly, as it encapsulates the essence of what it means to be human in a world where recognition often comes from the most unexpected avenues. 

Green's review isn't just about a hot dog eating contest; it's a microcosm of the human condition. He delves into the psychology behind why we, as a species, are so enamored with competitions that seem trivial or even grotesque. The contest, in this case, serves as a metaphor for the larger societal constructs that shape our ambitions and desires. We live in a world that often measures worth by the number of likes on social media, the amount of money in one's bank account, or even the number of hot dogs one can consume in a given time. These metrics, while seemingly inconsequential, reveal a deeper yearning for validation and a place in history, however fleeting that may be.

Green also touches on the duality of human nature, stating, "We are at once the most sublime and the most ridiculous animals, capable of writing symphonies and eating sixty-two hot dogs in ten minutes." This duality is what makes us fascinating but also deeply flawed. We have the capacity for great achievements, like landing on the moon or curing diseases, yet we also engage in activities that are detrimental to our well-being or seem utterly pointless. This paradox is what makes us human, and Green's review made me ponder this complexity in a new light.

Moreover, the review made me introspect on my own ambitions. What lengths would I go to for recognition or to "matter," as Green puts it? It's a sobering thought that challenges me to consider the ethical and personal boundaries of my own aspirations. Would I, given the chance, participate in a contest that might bring me fame but could also be seen as a symbol of excess and disregard for consequences? Green concludes his review by saying, "I don't know if our ridiculousness makes us sublime or our sublimity makes us ridiculous, but I do know that any account of our species that doesn't include both can't be true." This line resonated with me, as it encapsulates the enigma that is human nature.

In sum, John Green's review of Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest is a thought-provoking exploration into the intricacies of human desire, competition, and the duality that defines us. It made me question the societal norms that shape my own ambitions and gave me a newfound appreciation for the complexities that make us uniquely human.
