### Video: “What Aristotle and Joshua Bell can teach us about persuasion”

- Joshua Bell is considered one of the greatest violinists in the world. His minimum fee for playing a concert is $75,000.
	- 
- Washington Post Subway Experiment: Joshua Bell set up a spot in the subway to play for passersby. The experiment was videotaped on a hidden camera; of the 1,097 people who passed by, seven stopped to listen to him, and one recognized him. For his nearly 45-minute performance, Bell collected $32.17 from 27 passersby (excluding $20 from the one who recognized him).
	- 
    
- Logos:
	- Idea makes sense from the audience's point of view
	- good argument is like good music
	- makes sense to the audience
    
- Pathos:
	- stories
	- sometimes the audience is not ready
	- the speaker should create and environment where the audience can learn
	- no emotional bond between performer and listener in a subway
    
- Ethos:
	- reputation
	- credibility
	- trustworthy
	- authority
	- the subway does not have great trust for great art

How much do I rely on other institutions to tell me what is high quality and not?
- just because the concert hall is hosting a musician, doesn't mean that anyone outside the concert hall is worse
- How do institutions influence my belief on what is credible and what isnt.
