## Think aloud Guidelines
- State the title and author of the book and the act and scene where your passage appears. Your Think-Aloud should be about the same scene you are performing in class. 
- Provide some brief context for the passage—1-2 sentences that explain what’s happening in the plot at the time of your passage.
- Annotate your passage and take a picture of your work. Your annotations should appear organized and methodical. That might mean that you’ll use different colors for devices or focal “talking” points. 
- The Dramatic Performance in class will take the place of reading the passage out loud during your recording. You do NOT need to record yourself reading the scene at the beginning of your Think-Aloud. 
- Walk through your thinking as you go. Read a line or a few words at a time. Then pause: What do you notice? What does it make you think? What do you notice about the author’s style? How does it make you feel? Why? Aim for at least 3 observations.
- You will have 4-6 minutes.
- Record and upload yourself (with video on) talking about your passage.
- You must choose one of the play’s themes to explore in your think-aloud(partners need not choose the same theme):
	- After choosing your scene, you and your partner(s) will turn and talk to determine some of the themes you can talk about in your think aloud: 


## Script
In this segment of Act 5, Scene 1 from Shakespeare's "Twelfth Night," the plot's complexities begin to unravel, leading towards the resolution of the play's many misunderstandings and mistaken identities. The scene opens with Sebastian expressing his apologies to Olivia for injuring her relative, not realizing the full extent of the confusion his appearance has caused, given his striking resemblance to his twin sister, Viola, who has been disguised as Cesario.

Olivia, mistaking Sebastian for Cesario, is bewildered by his apology, as she believes him to be the same person she recently married, thinking he was Cesario. This misunderstanding underscores the play's themes of identity and disguise. The situation becomes even more complicated with the arrival of other characters, including Orsino, Viola (still in disguise), and Antonio, who earlier rescued Sebastian and has been arrested for past crimes against Orsino.

As the characters interact, the truth slowly emerges. Antonio recognizes Sebastian, expressing relief and confusion over seeing him alive and well, further complicating the narrative as he mistook Viola for Sebastian. This encounter leads to a series of revelations where the characters begin to piece together the puzzle of the twins' identities, although Viola's true identity is not yet disclosed in this segment.

Olivia's command to "enlarge him" refers to releasing Antonio from custody, indicating her authority and control over the situation, despite the confusion. This act of mercy also highlights the shifting dynamics and relationships among the characters as they navigate through their misunderstandings towards clarity and resolution.

This segment is pivotal in "Twelfth Night," as it sets the stage for the ultimate revelations and reunions that conclude the play, emphasizing themes of love, mistaken identity, and the complexities of human relationships.

**Making Connections:**
- I already know that mistaken identities are a common trope in Shakespeare's comedies, which reminds me of *The Comedy of Errors*, another play that involves twins and mistaken identities. This relates to the broader theme of identity and perception in literature. I experienced something similar when watching modern films that employ mistaken identity for comedic effect, illustrating how this theme remains relevant.

**Monitoring Comprehension:**
- I got lost here because of the rapid unraveling of mistaken identities. I’m guessing this means that all characters involved will come to understand each other's true identities, but I still need to know how each character reacts to these revelations. At first, I thought Olivia was aware of Cesario's true identity, but now I think she was genuinely confused.

**Asking Questions:**
- I wonder why Shakespeare chose to reveal the twins' identities at this particular moment? What if Sebastian had not arrived when he did? How come Orsino transitions so quickly from anger to acceptance and love towards Viola?

**Drawing Inferences:**
- I think this represents a culmination of the themes of identity, love, and misunderstanding. I’ll bet that Shakespeare is suggesting that true love prevails over confusion and chaos. What this means to me is the importance of truth and honesty in resolving conflicts.

**Visualizing:**
- In my mind, I see a scene of chaos turning into one of joyful revelation as characters express shock, confusion, and then relief. I can picture a bustling stage where each character's realization brings a new dynamic to the group, mirroring a dance of emotions. If this were a movie, this scene would be a pivotal moment, filled with dramatic music and close-ups on characters' faces as they piece together the puzzle.

**Noticing the Writer’s Craft:**
- I noticed a motif of mistaken identity, and I think it means Shakespeare is exploring the fluidity of identity and the superficial nature of appearances. The juxtaposition here makes me wonder about the roles society assigns to us and how they can be subverted. This passage starts by addressing the consequences of deception and then moves to reconciliation and love, and that might be because the author is trying to highlight the transformative power of truth and understanding.

**Synthesizing:**
- The conclusion I’m drawing is that understanding and empathy are key to resolving conflicts and forging deeper connections. I think this part is important because it shows the resolution of the play's central conflicts and sets the stage for the characters' futures. This part is connected to the Essential Question for the course about the nature of identity and how it shapes our interactions with others because it illustrates the complexity of identity and the impact of our perceptions on our relationships.
