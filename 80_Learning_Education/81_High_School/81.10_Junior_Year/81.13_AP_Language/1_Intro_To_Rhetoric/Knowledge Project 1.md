Title: Knowledge Project 1

Name of Article: Isabel Wilkerson, “America’s ‘untouchables’: the silent power of the caste system,” The Guardian, July 28, 2020.

Date of Episode: July 28, 2020

Topics/Issues Considered: (bullet points are fine)

- Racial Inequity
    
- Social Hierarchy
    
- Slavery, Colonies and American History
    
- Indian Caste System
    

Central argument/s and ideas it is trying to convey: (5-7 sentences)

The Central Idea that the Article is trying to convey is the lasting effects of slavery on the social dynamics of America as a country. By comparing the racial hierarchy in America to the caste system in India, we can see the similarities in how the system suppresses and segregates communities. To this end, Wilkerson claims that to understand and address these racial inequalities, people need to understand the caste-based foundation that caused this issue in the first place and take specific action to undo the ingrained and prejudiced structures that uphold it. To truly progress as a society, we must recognise and challenge these obscured hierarchy systems and work towards creating a more egalitarian society.

Reflection:

(6-8 meaty sentences)

The Article about America’s Untouchables was particularly engaging, delving into topics about the underlying caste systems that shape societies worldwide, particularly American culture. This article was essential because it discusses the Indian caste system as a building block for defining the new “American caste system.” My family and ancestors are part of that system and were subject to that system until recent years. The Indian Caste system has been around for a long time and is still in existence today, albeit somewhat discouraged by most politicians nowadays. The parallels between the caste system and America’s racial inequity are enlightening but rather unsettling, peeling back a layer to show a global pattern of human segregation and discrimination. This episode has not just educated me but also prompted a personal reckoning. Before reading the article, I understood that caste-based hierarchy was a singular issue in a country. Unsurprisingly, it was pretty discomforting to realise that these systems are not as foreign as I thought and are as much a part of the fabric of American society as they are in India. It made me reflect on the subtleties of discrimination that I may have subconsciously accepted or perpetuated daily. From now on, I’ll attempt to be more conscious of my biases and engage in conversations promoting understanding and change in the direction of equality.
