| - In "Frankenstein," the creature becomes malevolent after being rejected and isolated by society and its creator.       | - Jean-Jacques Rousseau's concept of man being inherently good, but corrupted by society suggests a parallel theme.     | - Some argue that evil is an inherent aspect of human nature, independent of external influences.                        |
| - The creature initially displays kindness, but turns to evil as a response to continuous rejection and lack of empathy. | - Psychological studies show that social rejection can lead to increased aggression and antisocial behavior.            | - It could be argued that the creature's actions were a result of innate characteristics rather than societal rejection. |
| - Victor Frankenstein's rejection of his own creation symbolizes the broader societal rejection faced by outcasts.       | - Historical examples, like the treatment of marginalized groups, reflect how societal rejection can foster resentment. | - Another viewpoint suggests that personal choice and moral integrity can overcome the effects of rejection.             |

-  **Artists, inventors, and other self-driven people are egotistical and selfish in the pursuit of their art or their talent.**

| - Victor Frankenstein, in his quest to create life, disregards the moral and ethical implications, driven by ego.        | - Historical figures like Steve Jobs and Pablo Picasso were known for their egocentric behaviors in their fields.          | - Many artists and inventors are motivated by a desire to contribute to society, not just by ego.    |
| - The obsessive nature of Frankenstein's work leads to neglect of his family and personal health, showing selfishness.   | - Biographies of great scientists and artists often highlight their self-absorption and neglect of personal relationships. | - Self-drive in artists and inventors can stem from passion and dedication, not necessarily egotism. |
| - The monster's creation is a result of Frankenstein's desire for glory and recognition, rather than altruistic motives. | - Psychological studies suggest that high creativity is often linked with narcissistic and self-centered traits.           | - The drive to innovate and create can coexist with empathy and social responsibility.               |

| - The creature in "Frankenstein" is judged and ostracized based on appearance, which leads to his malevolent transformation. | - Studies in social psychology show that physical appearance significantly influences first impressions and trust.   | - Avoiding judgments based on appearance is unrealistic due to innate human biases and instincts.               |
| - Frankenstein's initial revulsion at his creation's appearance leads to rejection, showing the impact of such judgments.    | - Evolutionary biology suggests that humans are hardwired to respond to physical appearance as a survival mechanism. | - Focusing solely on non-physical traits could overlook important aspects of personal safety and compatibility. |
| - The novel suggests that a world without physical judgment might have prevented the creature's descent into evil.           | - Historical and cultural norms have long placed significance on physical appearance in social interactions.         | - Physical appearance can provide important non-verbal cues about a person's health, hygiene, and lifestyle.    |

| - Victor Frankenstein's abandonment of his creation, akin to a child, shows a failure of parental responsibility.         | - Legal perspectives often emphasize the duty of care rather than unconditional love in parental responsibilities.  | - Unconditional love from parents is crucial for the emotional and psychological development of children.         |
| - The creature's descent into evil is partly a result of Victor's lack of paternal love and guidance.                     | - Psychological research indicates that love in parenting should be conditional to encourage good behavior.         | - Love in parenting should be unconditional to foster a secure and nurturing environment for the child.           |
| - Frankenstein's lack of empathy and understanding towards his creation reflects a failure in fulfilling parental duties. | - In cases of severe misconduct or harm, some argue that parents may withdraw love to protect themselves or others. | - The concept of unconditional love is fundamental to the parent-child relationship, regardless of circumstances. |
