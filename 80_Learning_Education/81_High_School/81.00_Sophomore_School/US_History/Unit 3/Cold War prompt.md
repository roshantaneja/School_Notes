answer the following prompt in a 5-7 sentence paragraph:  
  
How was the Cold War waged in practice? How did the practice of waging the Cold War differ from the ideological rhetoric about the Cold War?  
  
  
The Cold War was waged through various tactics, including military alliances, proxy wars, espionage, propaganda, and economic competition. USA and the USSR sought to expand their spheres of influence, with the US supporting capitalist democracies and the Soviet Union promoting communist governments. Despite efforts to defend democracy, the Cold War often contradicted the values that America so sought to maintain. For instance, the US upheld tyrant systems against socialism, while the Soviet Association severely stifled disagreement and attacked adjoining nations. Furthermore, both sides engaged in a nuclear arms race that posed an existential threat to humanity, despite their rhetoric about the need for peace. Ultimately, the Cold War was a war based on difference in ideology and power politics, with each side pursuing its national interest and portraying its actions as necessary for the greater good while oftentimes contradicting itself.
