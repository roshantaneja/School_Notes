## Exegesis of 1 Samuel 16:1-13

1 Samuel 16:1-13 tells the story of how God chose David to be the next king of Israel. The text begins by describing how the Lord spoke to Samuel, the prophet, and told him to go to the house of Jesse in Bethlehem. When Samuel arrived, he saw Jesse's oldest son, Eliab, and thought he must be the one God had chosen. However, the Lord told Samuel that he should not judge by outward appearances, but rather by the state of a person's heart. So, Samuel continued to look at Jesse's other sons, but none of them were chosen by God. Finally, Jesse brought out his youngest son, David, who was out tending to the sheep. The Lord told Samuel that this was the one he had chosen to be the next king of Israel. This passage is significant because it shows how God can choose anyone, even the least likely candidate, to fulfill his plans. It also emphasizes the importance of looking beyond outward appearances and focusing on a person's inner character. This passage highlights the importance of the heart in God's eyes. It also shows that God's choices are not always based on what humans consider to be important or valuable. In this case, God chooses David, the youngest and seemingly least important son, to be the next king. This shows that God looks at the heart and not just outward appearances. It also serves as a reminder that God's ways are not always the same as ours, and that we should trust in his choices and plans for us.

## 1 Samuel 16:1-13 - Samuel Appoints David
[1] The Lord said to Samuel, “How long will you mourn for Saul, since I have rejected him as king over Israel? Fill your horn with oil and be on your way; I am sending you to Jesse of Bethlehem. I have chosen one of his sons to be king.”

[2] But Samuel said, “How can I go? If Saul hears about it, he will kill me.”

The Lord said, “Take a heifer with you and say, ‘I have come to sacrifice to the Lord.’ [3] Invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what to do. You are to anoint for me the one I indicate.”

[4] Samuel did what the Lord said. When he arrived at Bethlehem, the elders of the town trembled when they met him. They asked, “Do you come in peace?”

[5] Samuel replied, “Yes, in peace; I have come to sacrifice to the Lord. Consecrate yourselves and come to the sacrifice with me.” Then he consecrated Jesse and his sons and invited them to the sacrifice.

[6] When they arrived, Samuel saw Eliab and thought, “Surely the Lord’s anointed stands here before the Lord.”

[7] But the Lord said to Samuel, “Do not consider his appearance or his height, for I have rejected him. The Lord does not look at the things people look at. People look at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart.”

[8] Then Jesse called Abinadab and had him pass in front of Samuel. But Samuel said, “The Lord has not chosen this one either.” [9] Jesse then had Shammah pass by, but Samuel said, “Nor has the Lord chosen this one.” [10] Jesse had seven of his sons pass before Samuel, but Samuel said to him, “The Lord has not chosen these.” [11] So he asked Jesse, “Are these all the sons you have?”

“There is still the youngest,” Jesse answered. “He is tending the sheep.”

Samuel said, “Send for him; we will not sit down until he arrives.”

[12] So he sent for him and had him brought in. He was glowing with health and had a fine appearance and handsome features.

Then the Lord said, “Rise and anoint him; this is the one.”

[13] So Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the presence of his brothers, and from that day on the Spirit of the Lord came powerfully upon David. Samuel then went to Ramah.
