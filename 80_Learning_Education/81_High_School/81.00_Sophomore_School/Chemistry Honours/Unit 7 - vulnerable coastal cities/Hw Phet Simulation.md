*ACTIVITY:  What makes a greenhouse gas different from a non-greenhouse gas?

  

Introduction:

Greenhouse gasses are gasses in Earth's atmosphere that trap heat also known as infrared (IR) light. Greenhouse gasses let sunlight pass through the atmosphere, but they prevent the heat (IR) that the sunlight brings from leaving the atmosphere.  However, visible light can enter and leave the atmosphere without it being trapped.

Directions:

Using the Greenhouse Gas simulation through Phet, we are going to examine different gases and determine what makes a particular gas a "greenhouse gas".

  

Please follow the link to the Greenhouse gas simulation

[https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/cheerpj/greenhouse/latest/greenhouse.html?simulation=greenhouse](https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/cheerpj/greenhouse/latest/greenhouse.html?simulation=greenhouse)

  

Once loaded into the simulation, proceed to the following investigation!

  

1.  Before you begin this investigation, predict what you might learn. Below, I want you to explain what YOU THINK the difference between a greenhouse gas and a non-greenhouse gas is. Your prediction should sound something like this, " I think greenhouse gases are different from non-greenhouse gasses because greenhouse gas ______________________ but non-greenhouse gasses ____________________________, which makes them different from one another"
    

  

Write your prediction below:

  
  
  

2.  Once into the simulation, click on the "photon absorption" tab on the top. See the image below.

Look at the key on the right side where it says "atmospheric gasses". How many different gasses are there? 

  

3.  Infrared Investigation: Set up the simulation so that you investigate the effect of shooting infrared light on a molecule.  Refer to the picture below. You will investigate all five gases by shooting infrared light at the molecules beginning with methane. 
    

1.  Before you begin this investigation, use the table below to record your prediction of what will happen to each molecule when the infrared energy hits the gas molecule.  
    
2.  Begin with methane, CH4.
    
3.  Watch the simulation for CH4, run until you see about 10 or so photons hit the molecule.

4.  Record your observations in the table below.
    
5.  Repeat for the other four molecules.

3.  What happens with molecules being exposed to visible light? How do you explain this behavior? 
    

  
  
  

4.  A greenhouse reflects Infrared (IR) light.  Which of the molecules you tested would be considered a greenhouse gas? 
    

  

5.  A non-greenhouse does not reflect Infrared (IR) light.  Which of the molecules you tested would be considered non-greenhouse gasses?
