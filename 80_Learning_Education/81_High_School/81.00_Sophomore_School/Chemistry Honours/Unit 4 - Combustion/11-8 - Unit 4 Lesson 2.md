## L4.2 Student Sheet

**Lesson 4.2: What are the products of rocket fuel and gasoline?

  

#### INTRODUCTION:

1.  Open up your [IMT](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oOD0KgRfL3Oq5ahvuiWuf3WLjWakWEk3/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=101610972662753304413&rtpof=true&sd=true) for this unit, and fill in the question and wondering for lesson 2
    

  

WRITING CHEMICAL EQUATIONS: 

As we learned from the last lesson, carbon dioxide is a product of a combustion reaction, but How do we write chemical reactions?  Use this link to find out [chemical reactions, word equations, 11.1](https://flexbooks.ck12.org/cbook/ck-12-chemistry-flexbook-2.0/section/11.1/primary/lesson/word-equations-chem/) 

  

-   Based on your reading, What is the word equation for methane and oxygen reacting? 
    

  
  

-   What are the reactants and products from this reaction? 
    

  

PREVIEW - READING: LIQUID HYDROGEN - THE FUEL OF CHOICE FOR SPACE EXPLORATION

1.  Read the article, [Rocket Fuel](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V10nTReeSfqYctfqBq6j10MACHyxtSkwR3mEY8jgrg4/edit?usp=sharing), two times. The first time, focus on any similarities between how hydrogen is used in a rocket and how gasoline is used in a car. The second time, focus on any differences.

DEMONSTRATIONS of Combustion Reactions:

  

1.  Magnesium ribbon
    

  

Equation:

  

2.  CH4 (Methane) bubbles
    

  

Equation:

  

-   What is a combustion reaction?  
    

  
  

-   What do all combustion reactions have in common?
    

  
  

#### MODELING:

Let’s use the molecular model sets to model the rocket fuel equation and the gasoline (octane) fuel equation. Go to the lab tables to do this, when you have your models made, ask your teacher to check your work. Take a picture of your models and insert below.

#### FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS:

  

1.  Based on your model, which fuel type would you choose?  Explain your reasoning.
    

  

2.  What other questions should you ask and answer to support your decision?
    

  

3.  Summarize the necessary components of combustion reaction.
    

  

4.  Research why most cars run on gasoline and not rocket fuel.  Explain in a few sentences.  
    

  
  

#### NAMING HYDROCARBONS 
[read and watch the video](https://flexbooks.ck12.org/cbook/cbse-chemistry-class-10/section/4.4/primary/lesson/saturated-hydrocarbon/) in the saturated hydrocarbons section in the textbook. Answer the following questions.

1.  What is a saturated hydrocarbon?
    
2.  How are saturated hydrocarbon compounds named?
    
3.  When naming hydrocarbons, whatare the prefixes used when there is 1 carbon, 2 carbons, 3 carbons, 4 carbons?
    
4.  What is the name of the saturated hydrocarbons with the formulas, C3H8, C7H16, and C4H10?
    

  

#### NEXT STEPS:

1.  Reflect on today’s question: What are the products of rocket fuel and gasoline?
    
2.  Open up the IMT for this unit, complete all boxes for lesson 2
    
3.  Make sure all parts of the L4.2 student sheet are complete & complete the check for understanding on schoology.**
