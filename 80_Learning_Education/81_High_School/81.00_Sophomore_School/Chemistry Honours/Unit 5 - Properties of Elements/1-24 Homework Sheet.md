# Homework: Smartphone Infographic 

  

Use the [Cellphone Chemistry Infographic](https://www.thinglink.com/scene/839574822739509252) to discover more about the chemistry of a smartphone. After studying the infographic answer the following questions. 

  

 How does a Lithium-Ion Battery work? Use infographic to answer

1.  What are 3 things that make lithium-ion batteries better than other batteries? 
    
Lithium Ion Batteries are useful for phones because they last longer, have higher energy density, are lighter than other types of batteries, and are rechargeable.

2.  What are 3 negative features of lithium-ion batteries? 
    
They start degrading ass soon as thy leave the factory. They only last 2-3 years from the date of manufacture, whether you use them or not. They are extremely sensitive to high temperatures. Heat causes lithium-ion battery packs to degrade much faster than they normally would. There is a small chance that if the battery pack fails, It'll burst into flames.

3.  What is the positive electrode made of? 
    
Lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO<sub>2</sub>)
  

4.  What is the negative electrode made of? 
    
Carbon

5.  What separates the negative from the positive electrode? 
    
a separator made of a very thin sheet of microperforated plastic.

6.  How long does a lithium-ion battery typically last? Does the number of charges matter? 
    
Between 2-3 years depending on usage.
  

What is the value of metals in your smartphone? Use infographic & information below.

7.  In what part of a smartphone are these metals used? 
    
| Metal     | Usage in Cellphone                                                                                                             |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Copper    | Used to make wires and connectors in the phone, most of the circuit board traces may use copper traces to improve conductivity |
| Silver    | Exceptionally conductive, Also used for conductive components in circuitry                                                     |
| Gold      | Used in circuit board because it is chemically stable and also conducts electricity                                            |
| Palladium | Used for multi-layer ceramic chip capacitors (MLCC)                                                                            |
| Platinum  | Used to coat electrodes to control the flow of electricity                                                                     | 
  

8.  Which metal is most common in smartphones based on mass? 
    
Copper

9.  Which metal is the most valuable metal in smartphones? 
    
Platinum at close to $22 Million for 1 ton of platinum

Do cell phones affect your health? Use infographic

10.  What kind of radiation do smartphones emit? Is this type of radiation dangerous? 
    
They emit RF (radio frequency) radiation

11.  Do cell phones cause cancer? 
    
There is no evidence that any amounts of RF radiation cause cancer or increases the risk of cancer in humans.

12.  What other health concerns are there for smartphones? 
	
More mental health related concerns of owning a smartphone
