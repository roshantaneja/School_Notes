Acids: When water is mixed with an acid, the acid donates an H+ ion to the water creating a hydronium ion (H3O+).  Here is a generic equation where the hydrogen dissociates one at a time where HA is the acid:

  

<center>HA + H2O ⇌ H3O+ + A-</center>

  

Example: HCl + H2O ⇌ 

  

For the following, write the equation for the dissociation of the acid.  Acids dissociate only one H+ at a time. You may need to add more equations until all of the hydrogens have dissociated.

  

1.  HNO2 + H2O ⇌ H3O^+ + NO2^-
    

  

Acid Name: Nitrous Acid

  

2.  H2SO4 + H2O ⇌ 2H3O^+ + SO4^-2
    

  

Acid Name: Sulfuric acid

  

3.  HF + H2O ⇌ H3O^+ + F-
    

  

Acid Name: hydrofluoric acid

  

4.  H3PO4 + H2O ⇌ 3H3O^+ + PO4^-3
    

  

Acid Name: Phosphoric acid

  

5.  H2S + H2O ⇌ 2H2O^+ + S^-
    

  

Acid Name: Hydrosulfic acid

  

6.  HClO2 + H2O ⇌ H3O^+ + ClO2^-
    

Hint:  Dissociate only one Hydrogen from the acid.

  

Acid Name:

  

Bases: When water is mixed with a base, then the base accepts a hydrogen ion (H+) from the water creating a hydroxide ion (OH-).

  

  <center>B- + H2O ⇌ OH- + HB</center>

  

Example: NH3 + H2O ⇌

For the following, write the equation for the formation of the base. 

  

1.  NO2- + H2O ⇌ HNO2 + OH
    

  
  

2.  Br- + H2O ⇌ HBr + OH
    

  
  

3.  CO32- + 3H2O ⇌ H2CO3 + 3OH
    

  
  

4.  SO42- + 2H2O ⇌ H2SO4 + 2OH
    

  
  

5.  PO43- + 3H2O ⇌ H3PO4 + 3OH
    

  
  

6.  ClO2- + 2H2O ⇌ H2ClO + 2OH
