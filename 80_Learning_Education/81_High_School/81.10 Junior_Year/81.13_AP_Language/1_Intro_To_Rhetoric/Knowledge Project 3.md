# Reactions and Insights

1. **Conversational Tone**: The podcast episode starts with a friendly and informal tone. The host, Alie Ward, acknowledges the show's supporters and even highlights a quirky review, showcasing the sense of community that the podcast has built with its audience.
    
2. **[Architectural Technology](70_Sources/70_Articles/70.00_Misc/Oologies/Architectural%20Technology.md)**: The episode seems to challenge listeners' preconceived notions about what [architectural technology](70_Sources/70_Articles/70.00_Misc/Oologies/Architectural%20Technology.md) is. While many might think it's about how arches are built or glass buildings with solar panels, the episode promises a deeper dive into the subject, hinting that it's not just about physical structures.
    
3. **Digital Architecture**: Iddris Sandu appears to be the guest expert, offering a unique perspective on the concept of architecture. He discusses the idea of "digital architecture" and emphasizes that the term "architect" can be both a noun and a verb. As a verb, it's described as a living process, bringing fragments of an idea into an actual product.
    
4. **Design and Building**: There's a mention of architects being the "doctors of the design world," finding "viruses" and "pathogens" in design and using certain elements to create buildings that protect and shelter people.
    
5. **Deeper Meaning**: Iddris appears to take a philosophical approach, discussing the constraints we put on ourselves (represented by "boxes") and the power of verbs to define actions.
6. **Empathy in Design**: The conversation touches upon the importance of empathy in the design process. The connections in design and architecture are intricately woven together by a single medium: empathy. This resonates with the idea that good design is not just about aesthetics or function but about understanding and catering to the needs and emotions of its users.
    
7. **Curiosity and Creativity**: Iddris delves into his background and emphasizes the significance of curiosity in his journey. He talks about his early experiments with technology, such as rerouting circuit boards and programming light bulbs, showcasing his innate drive to understand how things work.
    
8. **Digital Alchemy**: Iddris introduces the concept of "digital alchemy," which he describes as the reusability of products. Once a product's primary function is exhausted, it can be repurposed to create something entirely new. This perspective aligns with sustainable design principles and the idea of maximizing utility from available resources.
    
9. **Programming Basics**: The podcast takes a moment to educate the audience about the basics of programming. The history of programming is touched upon, from early automations in Baghdad to punch cards used in textile looms in the 1700s. There's a mention of Ada Lovelace, a pioneering figure in computing, underscoring the rich history and evolution of programming.
    
10. **Legacy Programming Languages**: The discussion briefly explores legacy programming languages like COBOL and Fortran, emphasizing the foundational role they've played in the evolution of technology.
