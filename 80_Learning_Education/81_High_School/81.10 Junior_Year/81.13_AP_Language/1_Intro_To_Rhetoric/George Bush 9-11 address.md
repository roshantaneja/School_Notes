Good evening.  
  
Today, our fellow citizens, our way of life, our very freedom came under attack in a series of deliberate and deadly terrorist acts. The victims were in airplanes or in their offices: secretaries, business men and women, military and federal workers, moms and dads, friends and neighbors. Thousands of lives were suddenly ended by evil, despicable acts of terror. The pictures of airplanes flying into buildings, fires burning, huge -- huge structures collapsing have filled us with disbelief, terrible sadness, and a quiet, unyielding anger. These acts of mass murder were intended to frighten our nation into chaos and retreat. But they have failed. Our country is strong.

A great people has been moved to defend a great nation. Terrorist attacks can shake the foundations of our biggest buildings, but they cannot touch the foundation of America. These acts shatter steel, but they cannot dent the steel of American resolve. America was targeted for attack because we're the brightest beacon for freedom and opportunity in the world. And no one will keep that light from shining. Today, our nation saw evil -- the very worst of human nature -- and we responded with the best of America. With the daring of our rescue workers, with the caring for strangers and neighbors who came to give blood and help in any way they could.

Immediately following the first attack, I implemented our government's emergency response plans. Our military is powerful, and it's prepared. Our emergency teams are working in New York City and Washington D.C. to help with local rescue efforts. Our first priority is to get help to those who have been injured, and to take every precaution to protect our citizens at home and around the world from further attacks. The functions of our government continue without interruption. Federal agencies in Washington which had to be evacuated today are reopening for essential personnel tonight and will be open for business tomorrow. Our financial institutions remain strong, and the American economy will be open for business as well.

The search is underway for those who were behind these evil acts. I have directed the full resources of our intelligence and law enforcement communities to find those responsible and to bring them to justice. We will make no distinction between the terrorists who committed these acts and those who harbor them.

I appreciate so very much the members of Congress who have joined me in strongly condemning these attacks. And on behalf of the American people, I thank the many world leaders who have called to offer their condolences and assistance. America and our friends and allies join with all those who want peace and security in the world, and we stand together to win the war against terrorism.

Tonight, I ask for your prayers for all those who grieve, for the children whose worlds have been shattered, for all whose sense of safety and security has been threatened. And I pray they will be comforted by a Power greater than any of us, spoken through the ages in Psalm 23:

Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I fear no evil for you are with me.

This is a day when all Americans from every walk of life unite in our resolve for justice and peace. America has stood down enemies before, and we will do so this time. None of us will ever forget this day, yet we go forward to defend freedom and all that is good and just in our world.

Thank you. Good night. And God bless America.

Understanding the importance of the speechic and annotate for ethos, pathos, logos

The speech you've posted is one that was delivered by President George W. Bush on the evening of September 11, 2001, following the terrorist attacks on the United States. This speech is often analyzed for its rhetorical effectiveness in conveying the gravity of the situation, while also seeking to unify the country and set a course for action. Below is the speech annotated for the rhetorical devices ethos, pathos, and logos.

---

**Ethos**: Ethos is the appeal to ethics, or credibility. Bush establishes credibility as the President of the United States and through his tone, which is both serious and compassionate.

> Today, our fellow citizens, our way of life, our very freedom came under attack in a series of deliberate and deadly terrorist acts.

**Pathos**: The use of "our" engages the emotion of unity and shared loss. The mention of "fellow citizens," "our way of life," and "our very freedom" is designed to evoke strong emotional responses.

> The victims were in airplanes or in their offices: secretaries, business men and women, military and federal workers, moms and dads, friends and neighbors.

**Pathos**: Listing the types of people who were victims serves to humanize them, reminding the audience that these were ordinary people, just like them.

> Thousands of lives were suddenly ended by evil, despicable acts of terror.

**Pathos**: Words like "evil" and "despicable" are loaded with emotion and are used to heighten the emotional impact of the tragedy.

> The pictures of airplanes flying into buildings, fires burning, huge -- huge structures collapsing have filled us with disbelief, terrible sadness, and a quiet, unyielding anger.

**Pathos**: The vivid imagery is designed to evoke strong emotions—disbelief, sadness, and anger.

---

> These acts of mass murder were intended to frighten our nation into chaos and retreat. But they have failed. Our country is strong.

**Logos**: The logical argument here is straightforward—despite the intention behind the attacks, they have not achieved their aim. This is a reassurance to the nation.

---

> A great people has been moved to defend a great nation.

**Ethos**: Further establishing American identity and credibility as a "great nation."

> Terrorist attacks can shake the foundations of our biggest buildings, but they cannot touch the foundation of America.

**Pathos and Logos**: An emotional appeal to the enduring spirit of America, contrasted with the physicality of buildings. The logic is in the distinction between material and immaterial strength.

> These acts shatter steel, but they cannot dent the steel of American resolve.

**Pathos**: The metaphor of American resolve as steel is emotionally powerful and evokes a sense of unbreakable spirit.

---

> Immediately following the first attack, I implemented our government's emergency response plans.

**Ethos and Logos**: As President, his role demands quick action. This adds to his credibility and provides a logical reassurance that steps have been taken for public safety.

---

> Our first priority is to get help to those who have been injured, and to take every precaution to protect our citizens at home and around the world from further attacks.

**Logos**: A rational plan is laid out for immediate action, appealing to the audience's need for a concrete plan in the midst of chaos.

> The functions of our government continue without interruption.

**Logos**: Further reassurance that despite the attacks, the government is still functioning, aiming to restore a sense of normalcy or security.

---

> I appreciate so very much the members of Congress who have joined me in strongly condemning these attacks.

**Ethos**: Highlights unity among different branches of government, adding to his credibility and the overall ethos of the speech.

> And on behalf of the American people, I thank the many world leaders who have called to offer their condolences and assistance.

**Ethos**: Extends the notion of unity to an international scale, making the American position seem more credible and supported.

---

> Tonight, I ask for your prayers for all those who grieve, for the children whose worlds have been **shattered**, for all whose sense of safety and security has been threatened.

**Pathos**: Asking for prayers is an emotional appeal, and mentioning children is particularly effective in evoking strong emotional responses.

> Even though **I walk through the valley of the shadow of death**, I fear no evil for you are with me.

**Pathos and Ethos**: The use of Psalm 23 not only evokes emotion but also aligns the President with a higher moral authority, increasing his ethos.

---

> Thank you. Good night. And God bless America.

**Ethos and Pathos**: Concludes by aligning himself with American values and shared spirituality, aiming to unify the country.

Overall, the speech is a balanced mix of ethos, pathos, and logos, aiming to comfort, reassure, and mobilize a nation in shock and grief
