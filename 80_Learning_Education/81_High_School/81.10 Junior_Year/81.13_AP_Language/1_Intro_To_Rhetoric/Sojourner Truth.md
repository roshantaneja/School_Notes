### Ethos:

1. **Religious References**: Truth employs religious ethos to establish her moral authority. By asking, “Where did your Christ come from? From God and a woman! Man had nothing to do with Him,” she both aligns herself with a higher moral authority and challenges the societal beliefs that diminish women’s worth.
    
2. **Personal Experience**: Truth builds her credibility by speaking from her own experiences as a black woman, born into slavery. This makes her a reliable voice to talk about both racial and gender issues.
    
3. **Direct Address**: By speaking directly to her audience ("Well, children"), she places herself in a position of moral and experiential authority, further strengthening her ethos.
    

### Pathos:

1. **Emotional Language**: The line “Well, children, where there is so much racket, there must be something out of kilter” uses colloquial and emotional language to create an immediate connection with the audience. The term "children" evokes a sense of familial relation and concern.
    
2. **Anecdotal Evidence**: Truth uses stories and examples from her own life to make emotional appeals. When she speaks about having had 13 children and seeing most sold into slavery, she touches the audience’s hearts and evokes sympathy and anger.
    
3. **Rhetorical Questions**: "Ain't I a Woman?" itself is a rhetorical question that evokes emotional pondering. It confronts the listener to think deeply about the societal norms that have discounted her, and by extension, other women, from the status of womanhood.
    

### Logos:

1. **Logical Sequence**: Truth's speech follows a logical sequence, providing point-by-point refutations of arguments used to justify the subjugation of women. For example, she speaks about the physical labor she has done to disprove the notion that women are weaker and less capable than men.
    
2. **Comparative Analysis**: She compares the opportunities and freedoms given to men versus those given to women, especially focusing on the intersections of race and gender. This provides a logical framework for her argument for equality.
    
3. **Counterarguments**: Truth acknowledges the arguments made by others to oppose women’s rights, such as the idea that Christ was a man. She effectively uses logic to counter these points, stating that Christ came from God and a woman, thereby involving women directly in divine history.
    

In summary, Sojourner Truth's "Ain't I a Woman?" is a masterful blend of ethos, pathos, and logos, which work in harmony to create a compelling argument for women's rights and against racial inequality. Through carefully chosen words, logical structure, and emotive storytelling, Truth makes an argument that transcends her time and continues to resonate today.
