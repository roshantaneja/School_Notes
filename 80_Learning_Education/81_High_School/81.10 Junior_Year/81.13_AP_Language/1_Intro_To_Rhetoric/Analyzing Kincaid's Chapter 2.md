| Barclays Bank              |        | Kincaid mentions the bank as a symbol of British colonial influence and economic control over Antigua.                                      |
| Mill Reef Club             |        | This club represents the division between the wealthy, often foreign, elite and the local population.                                       | 
| Pediatrician               |        | Through the story of the pediatrician, Kincaid illustrates the inadequacies and corruption within the healthcare system.                    |
| Headmistress of the school |        | Kincaid may use this example to highlight the colonial attitudes still present in the educational system.                                   |
| Queen Victoria             |        | A symbol of British colonial rule, Kincaid references Queen Victoria to emphasize the historical oppression.                                |
| Princess of England        |        | Possibly used to symbolize continuing colonial or outsider influence and the distant relationship between the colonizers and the colonized. |
