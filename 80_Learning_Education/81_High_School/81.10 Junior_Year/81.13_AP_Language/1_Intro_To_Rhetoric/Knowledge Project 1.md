PROCESS

  

For the first two knowledge projects, you are going to read/watch/listen to two pieces related to Isabel Wilkerson. [You can click here to find a list of choices](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ugVr1IWa13pX8ZKHLXLqng3V298kTkKFYehTV0muXTk/edit?usp=sharinghttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1ugVr1IWa13pX8ZKHLXLqng3V298kTkKFYehTV0muXTk/edit?usp=sharing). You may read an article, listen to a podcast, or watch an interview.

  

First, listen

Once every two weeks, you will listen to one episode of a podcast that explores a topic of interest to you. Listen while you walk, jog, ride your bike, lift, cook, drive to school, etc. You may select episodes from the following podcasts. (You do not have to listen to the same podcast each time.) 

  

Note: I have not listened to every episode of every podcast. Use your judgment, particularly if language is offensive. Use your critical thinking to evaluate the soundness of the arguments made and the speaker's credibility. Become a healthy, wise  consumer of digital media. Challenge yourself to listen to a podcast from each category.

Here is [a sample entry](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MdlWMB8wDBkKuIdswl_78b2QntWFPDz2/view?usp=sharing). 

  

Two Knowledge Project entries will be paired together as a single Formative/Minor assignment. Here is the [rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14Ls0Dg1W4di6_t8DYAJ7_s4J4AmsEgzc03QlpSvWV6w/edit?usp=sharing).


**Central argument/s and ideas it is trying to convey:**

1. The caste system, while often thought to be exclusive to societies like India, has deep-rooted implications in American society as well, particularly in the form of racial hierarchies.
2. Racial inequity in America is not merely a product of recent discrimination but has its foundations in a deep-seated caste system that has evolved over centuries.
3. The legacy of slavery and colonization has left an indelible mark on the American psyche, creating invisible barriers that still affect marginalized groups.
4. By comparing the caste system in India and the racial hierarchy in the U.S., one can see the similarities in the ways that both systems oppress and segregate communities.
5. Addressing racial inequities requires a deep understanding of this caste-based foundation and deliberate action to dismantle the ingrained prejudices and structures that perpetuate it.
6. To truly progress as a society, it's essential to recognize and challenge these hidden systems of hierarchy and work towards creating a more egalitarian future.

**Reflection:** Listening to the episode “America’s Untouchables” was a profoundly personal experience, as it unearthed my assumptions about the foundations of racial inequities. I felt a deep discomfort recognising that caste-like systems are not just a foreign concept but very much a part of the fabric of American society. Drawing parallels between the Indian caste system and America's racial hierarchy struck a chord with me. It made me ponder the subtleties of discrimination I may have unknowingly accepted or perpetuated in my daily life. The idea that these deeply ingrained hierarchies, shaped over centuries, influence our thoughts, actions, and perceptions is disconcerting. This episode has not just educated me but also prompted a personal reckoning. I am now compelled to reflect on my biases, challenge them, and actively participate in breaking down these systemic barriers. Moving forward, I feel a renewed responsibility to be more conscious of my prejudices and engage in conversations promoting understanding and change.
