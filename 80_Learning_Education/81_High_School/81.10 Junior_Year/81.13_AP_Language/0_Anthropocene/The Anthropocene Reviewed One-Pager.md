"Competitive eating, like so much of human endeavor, is at once inspiring and horrifying."

This quote captures the essence of the review and the paradox of human achievement. It's a microcosm of how we can be both amazed and appalled by what we're capable of.

### Why I Picked This Review:

- **Tone**: The tone is a mix of humor and existential reflection, making it both entertaining and thought-provoking.
- **The Thing Reviewed**: The subject matter is so bizarrely specific yet universally relatable as a symbol of human excess and ambition.

#### Something Random I Learned:

- The "Solomon Technique" of breaking the hot dog in half before eating. I'd love to know more about the history of competitive eating techniques.

#### Reflection:

This review made me wonder about the lengths people go to for fame or recognition, even in something as trivial as eating hot dogs. It made me think about my own ambitions and the societal constructs that make something like this a competition. It also made me ponder the duality of human nature—our ability to turn anything into a contest, for better or worse.

#### Outlook on Humanity:

Optimistic, because even though the review highlights the absurdity of the contest, it also celebrates the human spirit and our relentless drive to be better, even in trivial pursuits.

### Questions Left:

1. What inspired you to review something as unconventional as a hot dog eating contest?
2. Do you think such contests are a reflection of American culture specifically, or humanity in general?

### Someone I'd Send This To:

A friend who loves quirky sports and existential debates. This review is the perfect blend of both. The person who comes to mind for me is Sebastian Deras, but he's also reading this book so it may seem a little redundant to send it to him.

### New Word/Phrase Learned:

"Solomon Technique" - A method in competitive eating.

### Quoted Author:

No other author was quoted in this review, but the absence of external quotes made Green's own words all the more impactful.
