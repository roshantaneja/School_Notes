A collage of hot dogs, trophies, and a stopwatch, represents the competition, the glory, and the ticking clock of human endeavor.

| __Why I Picked This Review:__ <br> - **Tone**: The tone is a mix of humor and existential reflection, making it both entertaining and thought-provoking. <br> - **The Thing Reviewed**: The subject matter is so bizarrely specific yet universally relatable as a symbol of human excess and ambition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | __Questions Left:__ <br> 1. What inspired you to review something as unconventional as a hot dog eating contest? <br> 2. Do you think such contests are a reflection of American culture specifically or humanity in general?                                                            |
| __Something Random I Learned:__ <br> - The "Solomon Technique" of breaking the hot dog in half before eating. I'd love to know more about the history of competitive eating techniques.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | __New Word/Phrase Learned:__ <br>  "Solomon Technique" - A method in competitive eating.                                                                                                                                                                                                 | 
| __Reflection:__ <br> This review made me wonder about the lengths people go to for fame or recognition, even for something as trivial as eating hot dogs. It made me think about my ambitions and the societal constructs that make something like this a competition. It also made me ponder the duality of human nature—our ability to turn anything into a contest, for better or worse. The entire review was more of an introspection into the whole human race and our capacity for achievement, but also our tendencies for excess and disregard for consequences but also our complexities and "quirkiness" that make humans human. | __Someone I'd Send This To:__ <br>  A friend who loves quirky sports and existential debates. This review is the perfect blend of both. The person who comes to mind for me is __Sebastian Deras__, but he's also reading this book so it may seem a little redundant to send it to him. |
| __Outlook on Humanity:__ <br> Optimistic, because even though the review highlights the absurdity of the contest, it also celebrates the human spirit and our relentless drive to be better, even in trivial pursuits. One could also argue that its Pessimistic in the manner that sometimes the people with the public voices have little to no idea the power that they wield over a crowd. Overall the review serves as a testament to both sides of the story.                                                                                                                                                                         | __Quoted Authors:__ <br> - "part P.T. Barnum, part political scalawag" - Tom Robbins <br> _no authors are quoted in the text but Green does quote both sportscasters and PR managers of the event._                                                                                      |
