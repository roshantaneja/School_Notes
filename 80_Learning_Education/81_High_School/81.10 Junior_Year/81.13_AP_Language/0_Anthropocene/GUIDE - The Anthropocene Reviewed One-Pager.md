The Anthropocene Reviewed One-Pager 

---

In the “Post-Postscript” of the paperback edition of The Anthropocene Reviewed, John Green writes, “Usually, when I finish a book, it feels very over to me, because once a book is published, it’s no longer really mine. It belongs to the people who will read it, the people who will comingle their own experiences and emotions with the text…. The art and its viewer or reader make meaning together in a collaboration that transcends time and space. My feeling has always been that I make the words, and then leave them to become whatever kind of meaning a reader can find” (276). This assignment is your opportunity to find meaning in one of John Green’s review essays through a one-pager. 

A one-pager is an analytical, creative, and written response to a text that completely fills one side of a piece of paper. Treat this one-pager as a visual representation of your favorite review and your response to it. Which review would you give 5 stars, and why? (Essentially, you get to review the review.)

Required Details

1. Fill the entire page with color and text. There shouldn’t be any blank, white space. 
    
1. (a white background against text is okay.)
    
3. Clearly label each element of your one-pager.
    
4. Include the title of the book, the title of the review, the author, and the number of stars you give the review.  You should try to incorporate this element as creatively as possible. 
    
5. A quote that encapsulates what you loved about the review, and a brief explanation why.
    
6. An image or illustration. You do not have to be a 5-star illustrator to create a 5-star image. You may collage, draw, paint – whatever works to represent your idea with clarity and intentionality.
    
7. Choose three more responses from the following columns: two from the first column, and one from the second. 
    

| Column 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Column 2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| - Why you picked this review: <br>- Was it the tone? The humor? The thing that was reviewed? The way in which Green wrote the review? Please be specific. Use a couple of examples from the text. They can be references or quotes. <br>- Something totally “random” you learned that you’d now like to learn more about. <br>- A reflection (at least 5 sentences): What did the review make you wonder about? What kind of connections did you make to your own life? How did the review make you think about something specific in your own life?<br>- A tweet-length message (280 characters) to John Green. What would you say to him??<br>- Based on the review, would you describe Green’s outlook on humanity as optimistic or pessimistic? Why? Use 1-2 examples from your review to support your point. | - 1-3 questions you are left with: what would you want to ask the author if you could? <br>- Someone you would send the review to and why. <br>- A new word or phrase you learned. <br>- An author who was quoted, what the quote said, and why it appealed to you. |
