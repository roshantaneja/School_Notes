- pomegranate tree in backyard
	- When I moved to California in 2011, my neighbors had a huge pomegranate that dangled over the fence between our houses
	- My neighbors, Mr. and Mrs. Rao were amazing people. Between 60-70 when I first move at the age of 5
	- We always had our own fruit trees in our backyard, figs, avocados, lemons, apples, and peaches, but never pomegranates.
		- Why should we? After all, there were so many growing next door, right?
	- When I was 10, I noticed a little tree growing near the bushes along the fence a little ways down from the original pomegranate tree.
	- My grandparents ran a little pipe from our preexisting irrigation loop to the tree, and within 2 years, the tree began to bear fruit.
		- a little pomegranate tree
	- As if on cue, that summer, Mr. Rao's tree fell sick and died, leaving me with the pressure of keeping its only child alive.
	- In our first harvest, we received 4 massive fruits, bigger than grapefruits.
		- 2 of the fruits went to the Raos, grieving the loss of their own tree, and a little note specifying that even though their tree was gone, we would make sure that ours would survive.
		- 1 fruit went with my mother to the temple, for thankfulness
		- 1 fruit remained at home
			- We made a bowl of seeds, after 30 minutes of whacking
			- It was gone in 5 minutes.
	- The next year, 4 of our 6 pomegranates had been eaten by squirrels.
		- My grandfather and I purchased a huge net and covered the entire tree (which stood at about 7 feet tall at this point)
	- By 2018 the tree was bearing 10 - 12 fruits, for nearly the whole summer.
		- As usual, 2 would go to Mr. Rao, and 1 to the temple, leaving us with nearly 10 pomegranates. 
		- Whatever would we do with 10 pomegranates?
	- Over the last few years, I had gotten very close with Mr and Mrs Rao.
	- I would come to bring the pomegranates every summer and we would talk outside their front door just remembering the good times.
	- Just a month ago, Mr Rao died.
		- I wasn't even there. I was away at a residential program on the other side of the country.
		- When my mother came to pick me up, I finally learned what had happened.
		- " I felt my heart crack, slowly, like a pomegranate, spilling its seeds" - Trebor Healy, _A Horse Named Sorrow_
	- I don't see Mrs Rao much anymore
		- I still take out the trash bins for her every Tuesday night and bring them back in every Wednesday morning.
	- the tree is still standing, bearing fruit.
		- Once we collect them this month, I'll make sure Mrs Rao gets the Pomegranates.
- I give Pomegranates 5 stars.
