Pomegranates are not fruit; they're a task. A multi-seeded, succulent, red and sweet task that requires skill, time, and a hefty spoon. Their leathery skin protects a treasure trove of juicy arils, nature's equivalent of Gushers, that lie packed together like rubies in a jewel box.

Pomegranates have been enjoyed and revered for thousands of years, symbolizing abundance in many cultures. And modern science, for once, seems to back up ancient sentimentality. Research indicates that pomegranates are full of antioxidants, can improve cholesterol levels, and might even fight off some types of cancer. All this, and they're low in calories and fat. They are, perhaps, the healthiest inconvenience you can subject yourself to, a lesson in delayed gratification that pays off in health benefits and the occasional stained T-shirt.

Which brings me to my pomegranate tree.

When my family moved to California in 2011, my neighbors, Mr. and Mrs. Rao, had this gargantuan pomegranate tree that leaned over the fence between our properties like a kindly old neighbor. Mr. and Mrs. Rao were in their 60s and immediately made us feel at home. As a 5-year-old, I felt like they were my third set of grandparents.

We had figs, avocados, lemons, apples, and peaches in our yard, but we didn't need pomegranates. Why would we? We had this natural marvel growing next door. It wasn't until I was 10 that a pomegranate sapling appeared on our side of the fence, a little blessing from the Rao's tree. My grandparents tapped a tiny irrigation pipe to the tree, and, miraculously, it bore fruit within two years. As if cued by the universe, Mr. Rao's tree then fell sick and died. It left me with the Herculean task of keeping its only offspring alive.

Our first harvest brought us four enormous fruits, each larger than a grapefruit. Two went to the Raos, along with a note reassuring them that their tree's legacy would live on. One went to the temple with my mother, a gesture of gratitude. And the last one? We destroyed it with a spoon, gathered the seeds, and devoured them in less than five minutes. 

For a time, it seemed like the tree would continue to bless us with more fruit each year, despite some squirrel-induced setbacks. Mr. Rao would receive his share, as would the temple, leaving us pondering what to do with our remaining bounty.

The years went by, and I became close friends with Mr. and Mrs. Rao. Our summer tradition of sharing pomegranates became a cherished event, a way to remember the good times.

Mr Rao died last month. I had left for camp the day prior and didn't learn about it till I returned 3 weeks later. Nobody had told me because they "didn't want it to affect my studies". The grief was slow, as writer Trebor Healy wrote in *A Horse Named Sorrow*, "I felt my heart crack, slowly, like a pomegranate, spilling its seeds."

I don't think about death much. Maybe that's a good thing, all my life, I've been told that thoughts of death need to be "reported" 

I don't see Mrs. Rao much these days. She stays inside, understandably so. I take her trash bins out on Tuesdays and bring them back in on Wednesdays. The pomegranate tree, however, stands resilient, still bearing its burdensome yet glorious fruits. This month, once the harvest is in, I'll make sure Mrs. Rao gets her share.

The pomegranate teaches us lessons in patience, health, and community. It's a living connection to our neighbors and a constant reminder of the cycles of life and death. On the five-star scale so commonly used to quickly summarize our complex feelings, I give pomegranates 5 stars.

	- juice?
	- low calories/fat
- delayed gratification
- pomegranate tree in backyard
	- When I moved to California in 2011, my neighbors had a huge pomegranate that dangled over the fence between our houses
	- My neighbors, Mr. and Mrs. Rao were amazing people. Between 60-70 when I first move at the age of 5
	- We always had our own fruit trees in our backyard, figs, avocados, lemons, apples, and peaches, but never pomegranates.
		- Why should we? After all, there were so many growing next door, right?
	- When I was 10, I noticed a little tree growing near the bushes along the fence a little ways down from the original pomegranate tree.
	- My grandparents ran a little pipe from our preexisting irrigation loop to the tree, and within 2 years, the tree began to bear fruit.
		- a little pomegranate tree
	- As if on cue, that summer, Mr. Rao's tree fell sick and died, leaving me with the pressure of keeping its only child alive.
	- In our first harvest, we received 4 massive fruits, bigger than grapefruits.
		- 2 of the fruits went to the Raos, grieving the loss of their own tree, and a little note specifying that even though their tree was gone, we would make sure that ours would survive.
		- 1 fruit went with my mother to the temple, for thankfulness
		- 1 fruit remained at home
			- We made a bowl of seeds, after 30 minutes of whacking
			- It was gone in 5 minutes.
	- The next year, 4 of our 6 pomegranates had been eaten by squirrels.
		- My grandfather and I purchased a huge net and covered the entire tree (which stood at about 7 feet tall at this point)
	- By 2018 the tree was bearing 10 - 12 fruits, for nearly the whole summer.
		- As usual, 2 would go to Mr. Rao, and 1 to the temple, leaving us with nearly 10 pomegranates. 
		- Whatever would we do with 10 pomegranates?
	- Over the last few years, I had gotten very close with Mr and Mrs Rao.
	- I would come to bring the pomegranates every summer and we would talk outside their front door just remembering the good times.
	- Just a month ago, Mr Rao died.
		- I wasn't even there. I was away at a residential program on the other side of the country.
		- When my mother came to pick me up, I finally learned what had happened.
		- " I felt my heart crack, slowly, like a pomegranate, spilling its seeds" - Trebor Healy, _A Horse Named Sorrow_
	- I don't see Mrs Rao much anymore
		- I still take out the trash bins for her every Tuesday night and bring them back in every Wednesday morning.
	- the tree is still standing, bearing fruit.
		- Once we collect them this month, I'll make sure Mrs Rao gets the Pomegranates.
- I give Pomegranates 5 stars.
