Other cases may result from complications during pregnancy, such as infections, premature delivery, maternal consumption of alcohol, or brain injuries.
    
13. **Neurobiology and Genetics**: ADHD involves complex interactions between brain function, genes, and behavior. For instance, genetic mutations can impact the development of the brain, leading to issues with connectivity in various regions. Neurotransmitters like dopamine and norepinephrine play significant roles in ADHD.

These deficits lead to challenges like poor time management, impulsivity, and emotional dysregulation.

16. **Diagnosis Process**: A comprehensive diagnosis of ADHD requires a thorough evaluation, often taking two to three hours or more. This process includes reviewing the individual's history, symptoms, and potentially conducting psychological testing to rule out other disorders.

17. **Impact of Diagnosis**: Receiving an ADHD diagnosis can be therapeutic, shifting the individual's perspective from self-blame to understanding their condition as a neurodevelopmental disorder. This change in mindset is crucial for effective management and acceptance of the condition.
