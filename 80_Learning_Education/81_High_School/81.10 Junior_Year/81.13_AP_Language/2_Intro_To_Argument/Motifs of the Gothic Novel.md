1. **The birth of the Gothic novel:**
    
    - Gothic literature emerged as a distinctive genre in the late 18th century, characterized by its focus on horror, death, and the supernatural, often set in gloomy, medieval settings.
2. **Henry Walpole’s Dream:**
    
    - Henry Walpole is often credited with launching the Gothic genre with his 1764 novel "The Castle of Otranto." His dreamlike, imaginative storytelling set the tone for subsequent Gothic literature.
    - According to Horace Walpole, his dream of **a giant armored hand at the top of a staircase** inspired his novel The Castle of Otranto. Walpole was an English writer and politician who lived from 1717 to 1797. The Castle of Otranto is considered the first Gothic novel.
    - Walpole said that he had the dream while suffering from gout at Strawberry Hill House in 1764.  The dream was laudanum-induced. Walpole said that he saw a giant hand come down from the ceiling above the landing.  He also claimed that he saw a ghost in the nightmare.
    - Walpole incorporated imagery from his dream into the novel, along with his knowledge of medieval history. The novel is about Manfred, the Prince of Otranto, who is obsessed with maintaining his family's name and property.
