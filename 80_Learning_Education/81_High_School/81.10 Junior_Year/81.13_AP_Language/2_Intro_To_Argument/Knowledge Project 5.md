Important quotes

1. **On the Nature of Futurology:** "Futurology. Very much a thing in a scholarly sense and it’s also called future studies sometimes futurism although we’re gonna talk more with this week’s guest about that. But it’s the study of possible, probable and preferable futures. So it’s a social science like history but the gearshift goes forward rather than in reverse"​​.
    
2. **On Social Changes in the Future:** "I think that and this is an unpopular answer given that I live in Berkeley which is in tech central kind of area but I think it's social stuff that's going to change the most. I think right now we're seeing a really awesome moment with like gender for example where people are sort of like… we're finally realizing in the more popular culture that gender is not binary and that people have different options and it's more acceptable to kind of talk about those questions"​​.
