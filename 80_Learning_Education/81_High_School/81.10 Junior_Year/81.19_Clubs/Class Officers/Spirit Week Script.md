Tone: Very quick, dramatic, and preferably high quality dialogue and production value with room for improv for comedy

Lines: 70% quippy and dramatic, 30% well placed humor. Keep the balance right to keep the video high quality while making people laugh. 

1. Rock n Jock Players Abduction (short, dramatic, shock factor, builds massive tension)

 The camera cuts out after the masked figure throws it to the ground. The camera is broken, but we can still see the blurry background of the rock n jock players being taken by (whoever the bad guys end up being)

2. Quick, dramatic scene in the fbi headquarters (avery’s dad’s company offices in sf) of agents trying to find the men for the job (this would be really cool if we made it high quality, which should be easier if it’s short)
3. FBI head character calls up two agents on the case
4. Agents head to (and possibly stake out)  the suspected enemy base. During this, scene, a spanish intelligence officer (luca) calls, telling the head that it’s a trap

FBI head scrambles to tell the agents “abort” 

5. Agents ambushed, during their escape they see the rock n jock characters being taken away
6. Car chase back to campus
7. Battle scene with FBI agents fighting the masked figures, while the two main heroes fight and defeat the main bad guy who explains his motivations (which should maybe be kinda funny)
8. Rock n jock players freed (serious comedy potential here)
9. Ending needs work, i’m not sure how to finish it
