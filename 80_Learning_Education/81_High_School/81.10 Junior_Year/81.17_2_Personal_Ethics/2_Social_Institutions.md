Diffusion: Ideas and actions are dissmeniated. Positive impacts are shown. Support from Interest groups grow. Will always have some resistance groups.

Legitimization: Becomes a formal Institution or changes an established organization, mantained by power. Values and norms become a part of culture.

Partial Insitintiutionalization: Himan praxis no longer aligns or recieve positive impact form institutions. New ideas begin to form.



### Social Dominance Theory

Social dominance can be described as the assertion of power by one group or groups over another through **hierarchies**.

Social dominance occurs when one group, or person, assumes the **hegemonical** (most powerful) role over other social groups. 

Social dominance is usually based on a combination of economic status, race, gender, religion, etc. (also known as **intersectionality**).
