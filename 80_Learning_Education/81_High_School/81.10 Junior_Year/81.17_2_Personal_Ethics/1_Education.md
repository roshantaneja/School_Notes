**Education as a Transformational Tool**

- Education serves as a pivotal means for the transformation of life and the achievement of liberation, aiming for a seamless integration of teaching and learning processes.

**Problem-Posing Education: A Framework for Empowerment**

- Central to this approach is the concept of praxis, which emphasizes education grounded in values through a cyclical process of teaching, action, and reflection.
- It fosters an environment where dialogue is paramount, encouraging active participation from both teachers and learners.
- The approach is built on the foundation of conscientization, where teachers and learners engage in a deep awareness of their reality through reflection and action, facilitating a two-way conversation and collaboration in addressing problems and solutions.
