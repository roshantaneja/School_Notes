The investigation, "Alone and Exploited, Migrant Children Work Brutal Jobs Across the U.S.," reveals a distressing panorama of exploitation involving migrant children across various industries in the United States. These children, many of whom arrive unaccompanied and driven by economic desperation exacerbated by the pandemic, find themselves in dangerous jobs that blatantly violate child labor laws. The narrative unfolds through data, personal stories, and insights into systemic failures, painting a comprehensive picture of a pressing issue.

**Main Findings:**

- **Epidemic of Child Labor:** Migrant children are employed in hazardous jobs across the U.S., including in factories that manufacture products for well-known brands. They work in conditions that are illegal for minors, such as roofing, meat processing, and operating heavy machinery.
- **Systemic Breakdown:** The investigation highlights the breakdown of systems meant to protect children, with many slipping through the cracks of government agencies and ending up in exploitative work environments. The Department of Health and Human Services (H.H.S.), responsible for the welfare of these children, often fails to prevent or even recognize their exploitation.
- **Economic Desperation:** The economic desperation in their home countries, particularly in Central America, pushes children towards these jobs. Many of them are burdened with debts from their journey and are exploited by sponsors who see them as a source of income.
- **Impact on Education and Health:** The demanding work schedules and unsafe conditions significantly impact these children's education and health. Many drop out of school and suffer from injuries and chronic fatigue.
- **Inadequate Response:** The response from companies and government agencies has been largely inadequate. While some corporations have pledged to investigate the allegations, the enforcement of child labor laws remains weak, with penalties often too minor to act as a deterrent.

**Personal Narratives:**

- Stories of children like Carolina, who works long hours in a food processing plant, and Cristian, who dropped out of school to work, put a human face on the statistics. These narratives reveal the harsh realities behind the exploitation, including long hours, dangerous work conditions, and the impact on their education and future prospects.

**Conclusion:**

The report concludes with a call to action for better enforcement of existing laws, more robust protection systems for migrant children, and a societal commitment to ending child labor. It emphasizes the need for comprehensive policy changes, increased resources for enforcement agencies, and greater corporate responsibility to address the root causes of this exploitation.
