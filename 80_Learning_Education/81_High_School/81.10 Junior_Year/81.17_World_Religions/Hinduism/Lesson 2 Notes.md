### a. Origins of Hinduism

Hinduism has no single founder and is a complex, pluralistic tradition with roots going back thousands of years. It is generally believed to have originated in the Indian subcontinent. The term "Hindu" is derived from the Sanskrit word "Sindhu," which was the historical local appellation for the Indus River. The religious, philosophical, and cultural practices that originated in India were termed as 'Hindu' by foreign invaders who used the term to denote the inhabitants of the Indian subcontinent.

The religion has been shaped and enriched by various historical and social contexts, as well as numerous teachers, saints, and philosophers over the millennia. The ancient scriptures of the Vedas and Upanishads are considered foundational texts that set the groundwork for various schools of thought, philosophies, and practices within Hinduism.

### b. Hindu Scriptures

1. **Vedas**: These are the most ancient and sacred texts of Hinduism, written in early Sanskrit and composed over several centuries. The Vedas are made up of four main textsâ€”Rigveda, Samaveda, Yajurveda, and Atharvaveda.
    
2. **Upanishads**: Philosophical texts that explore the concepts found in the Vedas.
    
3. **Mahabharata and Ramayana**: These are epic tales that are also considered sacred texts. The Mahabharata contains the Bhagavad Gita, a dialog between Prince Arjuna and the god Krishna, who serves as his charioteer.
