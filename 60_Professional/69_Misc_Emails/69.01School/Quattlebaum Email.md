Subject: My Statement


Mr Quattlebaum,

As requested I will recount the events of Tuesday, December 19th.
I will keep this as concise and accurate as possible. Any and all details I remember clearly will be included. Any details I am not confident in my memory of them will be omitted or otherwise specified as unclear.

1. I entered the Lucas Library after being called in by Ms Picetti
2. Set my phone down in the designated area.
3. Set my backpack down in the designated area.
4. I realize that I have left my folder with the packet required for the assignment at home.
5. Grabbed my laptop and charger (no other devices) and sat in a Spanish 4 designated spot.
6. This is the first time I've taken a Spanish test in the ASC. All of the other major assessments were taken in class, I never used extended time on any of them
7. I opened up 4 tabs in total:
	1. The Schoology assignment that contains the instructions for students with typing accommodations and a link to the Google Doc to copy
	2. 3 PDFs all linked to the Schoology assignment (supposed to come in a hard packet for students all of which were provided later by the ASC)
8. I began my test, which was split-screened between Google Docs and the PDF resources for the assignment.
9. 5 minutes into my test, a coordinator (I don't remember who) asked me to close the other tabs on my screen. 
	1. I showed him that they are the required PDFs for the assignment and that the Google doc is copied from the assignment and shared with Profe Victoria as mentioned in the instructions for students with typing accommodations. 
	2. I show him all of the tabs I have open. 
	3. They leave.
10. 2 to 3 minutes later Ms McDonald came to my desk and asked me to close my tabs.
	1. Once again, I explain that I am following the instructions from the Schoology assignment and do not have the required packet. 
	2. I show her all of the tabs I have open.
	3. She also leaves.
11. Ms McDonald comes by with the packet in hand, and I close the rest of the PDF tabs on my computer and fullscreen the singular tab with the Google doc.
12. 2 to 3 minutes later, Ms Picetti came to my desk and asked if I had a typing accommodation.
	1. (I now understand what the difference is in my accommodation packet and that I did not have a typing accommodation).
	2. I say yes.
13. Ms Picetti sits next to me on my desk.
	1. I continue my exam as usual with the hard packet in hand.
	2. No other tabs on my computer.
14. 5 minutes later, Profe Victoria comes into the library.
	1. He says that he will not accept my submission, states that I must be manipulating the Google doc and that he is very disappointed.
15. Ms Picetti suggests we talk outside the library so I grab my things and meet with Profe Victoria and Ms Picetti outside the library in the stairwell.
16. Profe Victoria reiterates that he will not accept my submission.
	1. In addition to that, he is unhappy that I have forgotten my packet at home.
	2. He says he is busy and needs to proctor the other students in his room.
	3. He leaves.
17. I told Ms Picetti that I was not cheating and that there was probably some kind of mistake.
18. She told me that I did not have a typing accommodation and that I should email Profe Victoria about a potential retake.
	1. I agree.
19. Ms Picetti tells me that I should go home.
20. I walk home, find my packet and return to school with it.
21. I waited until the D period final block ended and brought the packet to Profe Victoria.
	1. We agree on a retake on Friday the 21st.
22. I go back home and email both Ms Picetti and Profe Victoria the following email.

Dear Profe Victoria

I sincerely apologise for the confusion and inconvenience caused during today's D-period final exam. After my C period final, I went straight to the ASC during my D period without prior communication. I realised that taking the test digitally, especially without formal typing accommodation, was not within the requirements of the exam.

I deeply regret my actions, which were not an attempt to gain an unfair advantage. I understand the gravity of my situation and the mistakes I have made. What I did was wrong.

Throughout the past semester, I have proceeded with all of the major assignments with the utmost care and detail, and I value the learning and guidance you have provided in Spanish 4. I would like to rectify this situation immediately. To that end, after my exam was voided today, I ran back home, grabbed the outline as required and brought it to you today after D period had ended. In this meeting, we agreed to retake the final exam during the G period block on Friday. I assure you I will adhere to the exam conditions as specified.

I am also copying Ms Picetti in this email to keep them informed. I am most grateful for the ASC and its accommodations, and I hope to continue utilising these resources responsibly. If disciplinary action is necessary for my mistake, I am more than understanding to accommodate.

Thank you for considering my request earlier today, and I apologise again for any disruption caused. I also apologise for causing you to leave your classroom during the final to attend to my mistake. I look forward to completing your final under the specified exam conditions on Friday and continuing to learn in your class in the new year.

Sincerely
Roshan

23. I retook the test on the 21st, there were no qualms, and no other issues.
