Hey! I'm a high schooler from Menlo Park, California, super into robotics—it's pretty much my life. But when I'm not building robots, I'm writing about my adventures and experiences. It's a cool way to share my stories. I love cookie dough ice cream and blueberries. Also, I love hanging out with my friends, just biking around town and having a good time. School, robots, writing, and friends—that's me in a nutshell!

150 Word Bio

As a high-school student from Menlo Park, California, I find myself deeply immersed in the dynamic world of robotics. This field is not just a hobby for me; it's a passion that occupies most of my time. However, when I manage to carve out a moment from my busy schedule, I indulge in another love of mine: writing. I have a keen interest in narrating stories, especially those that revolve around my life and experiences. These stories are more than just words; they are a window into my world. Outside the confines of school and robotics, I cherish the time spent with my friends. We often explore the vibrant streets of Menlo Park, cycling through its scenic routes and enjoying the lively ambiance of our town. This balance of technology, creativity, and outdoor activities not only shapes my academic pursuits but also my personal growth and connections within my community.
