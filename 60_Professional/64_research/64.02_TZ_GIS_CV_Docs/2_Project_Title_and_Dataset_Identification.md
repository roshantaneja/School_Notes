## Introduction to WATER-VISION

### Background:

The project, WATER-VISION, is focused on addressing the critical issue of water scarcity in the Monduli District of Arusha, Tanzania. This region, predominantly inhabited by the Maasai communities, experiences significant challenges in water availability, affecting daily life, health, and economic activities.

### Problem Statement:

Traditional methods of locating water harvesting units in Monduli District rely heavily on ground surveys. These methods are not only time-consuming but also often fail to accurately capture the dynamic nature of community settlements and fluctuating water needs. Consequently, there is a growing demand for an innovative solution that can efficiently identify areas with high population density and the greatest need for water resources.

### Project Brief:

#### Objective:

To employ satellite imagery combined with computer vision techniques for identifying high-density population areas in the Maasai communities of Monduli District. The goal is to determine the most effective locations for establishing new water harvesting units.

#### Approach:

1. **Data Collection**: Employ high-resolution satellite imagery to gather comprehensive geographical and infrastructural data of the Monduli District.
2. **Computer Vision Analysis**: Apply computer vision algorithms to analyze satellite images, focusing on detecting human settlements and estimating population densities.
3. **Collaboration with Local Experts**: Engage with local authorities and community leaders to validate the computer vision findings and integrate on-the-ground insights.
4. **Mapping High-Demand Areas**: Develop detailed maps pinpointing regions with the highest demand for water harvesting units, considering population density and existing water access.
5. **Project Planning and Implementation**: Strategically plan and implement the installation of water harvesting units in identified locations, maximizing impact and accessibility.
6. **Monitoring and Evaluation**: Regularly assess the effectiveness of the water harvesting units, adapting strategies based on population dynamics and evolving needs.

#### Expected Outcomes:

- Accurate identification of areas in need of water harvesting units.
- Streamlined resource allocation and expedited project execution.
- Improved access to clean water for the Maasai communities, fostering better health, education, and economic growth.
- Establishment of a scalable and replicable framework for similar initiatives in other regions.
