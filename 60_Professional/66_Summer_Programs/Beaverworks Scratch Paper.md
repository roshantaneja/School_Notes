Growing up in an era marked by staggering technological advancements juxtaposed against persistent global inequities has profoundly shaped my worldview and aspirations. As a student at Sacred Heart Preparatory (SHP), I've been privileged to immerse myself in a community that champions both academic excellence and social responsibility. This environment has not only nurtured my passion for computer science but also instilled in me a deep commitment to leveraging technology for social good.

One of the most pivotal experiences in my journey was leading a service project for the Maasai community in Tanzania. Collaborating closely with my brother and galvanizing support from our local community, we embarked on a mission to address environmental resource management challenges. This endeavor significantly enhanced my leadership abilities and provided invaluable insights into the complexities of sustainable development.

The stark contrasts I witnessed—between the technological affluence at SHP and the resource scarcity faced by the Maasai—have galvanized my resolve to bridge these divides. Engaging with individuals like Joseph, who despite having limited access to basic necessities, displayed an acute awareness of global issues, further reinforced my belief in the transformative potential of technology. His resourcefulness, using shoes crafted from tires and a cellphone as his window to the world, starkly highlighted the disparities in access to resources and information.

These experiences have underscored the barriers that impede equitable development, such as the digital divide, educational disparities, and environmental degradation. Yet, they have also illuminated pathways to overcoming these obstacles. By harnessing my skills in computer science—whether through developing a Python script to solve complex mathematical problems or creating a website to support women's health initiatives—I've begun to explore how technology can serve as a catalyst for positive change.

My journey has also been enriched by diverse experiences ranging from waking up early to teach painting to children across the globe, to convincing peers to join me in Tanzania. These moments have not only challenged my perspectives but also provided opportunities to apply my knowledge in robotics and computer-aided design (CAD) towards meaningful projects.

Looking ahead, I am driven by the aspiration to contribute to a world where technology facilitates, rather than exacerbates, social equity. I envision leveraging my technical skills and leadership experiences to develop innovative solutions that address critical global challenges, ensuring communities worldwide have equitable access to education, health care, and economic opportunities.

In summary, the world I come from—a blend of privilege, opportunity, and exposure to global inequities—has profoundly shaped my dreams and aspirations. It has imbued me with a sense of purpose to use technology as a force for good, striving to bridge the gap between what is and what could be, for communities around the globe.
