In my sophomore year, I learned a profound lesson about the dynamics of giving and receiving within a community through an unexpected collaboration. The catalyst for this learning experience was Eliza, a fellow student who, despite her frequent visits to our school's robotics lab, expressed no interest in robotics itself. It became evident that Eliza was searching for a way to connect with the community around her, yet felt uncertain about her place within the robotics team.

Eliza's background was in layout management for the school newspaper, a skill set not traditionally associated with robotics. However, the robotics competition we participated in required something unique: an engineering portfolio, a component our team had historically approached with minimal effort. Seeing an opportunity, I proposed to Eliza that she could contribute to the robotics team by lending her design expertise to enhance our engineering portfolio.

This collaboration brought to light the essence of community within our robotics team. By inviting Eliza to apply her talents, we not only welcomed her into our fold but also acknowledged the importance of every member's contribution, regardless of how directly related to robotics it might seem. Eliza's involvement transformed our approach to the engineering portfolio, elevating it from a basic document to a professionally designed showcase of our work. Her contribution was instrumental in our team winning the Impact and Design awards at almost every competition, a testament to the value of her work.

This experience illuminated the reciprocal nature of community engagement. Eliza received a sense of belonging and purpose within the robotics team, while the team benefited immensely from her unique skills. It was a vivid reminder that communities thrive on the diversity of their members' contributions. By both giving to and receiving from our community, we created a more inclusive, dynamic, and successful team environment.

The collaboration with Eliza underscored the importance of looking beyond conventional roles and recognizing the potential in everyone around us. It demonstrated that when we open our community to diverse talents and foster a culture of mutual support, we not only achieve our goals but also enrich the experience for all members involved. This lesson in the power of community—of both contributing to and drawing from its collective strength—has stayed with me as a guiding principle in all my endeavors.
