Growing up in a world marked by stark contrasts between technological advancement and global inequities, my aspirations and dreams have been deeply influenced by the opportunities, barriers, experiences, and challenges I have encountered. Attending Sacred Heart Preparatory, a private school known for its emphasis on academic excellence and social responsibility, provided me with a unique vantage point. My coursework in areas like computer science, engineering, and robotics, combined with a strong academic record, fostered a fascination with technology's potential to solve real-world problems.

However, it was not just the academic opportunities that shaped me. The completion of specialized courses such as the CITI Program's Human Subjects Research and the MIT Beaver Works Summer Institute course on Version Control deepened my understanding of ethical research practices and collaborative technology use. These experiences underlined the importance of responsible and inclusive technological advancement.

Perhaps the most transformative aspect of my journey has been my involvement with the Maasai community in Tanzania through the Maji Wells initiative. Leading this project not only honed my leadership skills but also opened my eyes to the critical issue of water scarcity and its impact on education, health, and economic opportunities for marginalized communities. Our efforts in water harvesting significantly improved daily lives by reducing the time spent on water collection, which directly translated into better educational outcomes and economic activities for the community. This initiative was a practical application of my interests in technology and social good, reinforcing my belief in technology's power to address global challenges.

The contrast between the technological abundance in my educational environment and the scarcity in communities like the Maasai's has deeply impacted my worldview. It has spurred a dream to leverage technology to bridge such gaps, aiming to make essential resources like clean water and education accessible to all. This aspiration is not just about applying what I have learned in computer science or engineering; it's about embodying the spirit of innovation for the greater good. My experiences have taught me that technology, when applied thoughtfully and ethically, can be a powerful tool for social change. My goal is to contribute to a world where technology serves as a bridge rather than a divider, ensuring equitable access to resources and opportunities for communities worldwide.
