### Lecture Notes: Temperature Structure of the Atmosphere and the Greenhouse Effect

#### Introduction to Temperature Structure and Lapse Rate
- Understanding global warming requires knowledge of the temperature structure of the atmosphere.
- Key concept: Lapse rate – the rate at which temperature decreases with an increase in altitude.
- Greenhouse effect: Related to how temperature changes vertically in the atmosphere.

#### Temperature Variations in the Atmosphere
- Temperature structure of the atmosphere: Changes in temperature as a thermometer is moved up and down.
- Example of temperature variation in a house: Attic is the warmest room due to hot air rising and accumulating at the top.

#### Convection and Circulation
- Convection in a pot of water: Heating from the bottom creates circulation with hot water rising and cold water sinking.
- Similar processes occur in the atmosphere, creating convection currents.

#### Atmospheric Convection and Temperature
- Convection in the atmosphere: Sun heats the ground, causing warm air to rise and cold air to sink.
- This process is observed in nature, such as birds soaring on thermals and hang gliding.

#### Difference Between House and Atmosphere
- Houses are short, with negligible pressure differences between rooms.
- The atmosphere is tall, with significant pressure differences between high and low altitudes.

#### Gas Laws and Temperature Changes
- Rising air expands and cools due to lower pressure.
- Sinking air is compressed and heats up.
- Examples: Compressed air cans cool when released, and tires heat up when inflated.

#### Temperature Structure and Atmospheric Layers
- Hot air rises but cools as it ascends, remaining warmer than the surrounding air at the same altitude.
- Cold air sinks but warms as it descends, remaining cooler than the surrounding air at the same altitude.

#### Lapse Rate
- Dry lapse rate: 10 Kelvin per kilometer.
- Explanation involves gravitational constant (g) and heat capacity of air (Cp).
- Example calculation: Temperature change in a lecture hall.

#### Moist Lapse Rate
- Water vapor affects lapse rate.
- Relative humidity (RH) and cloud formation occur when RH reaches 1.
- Water vapor condenses, releasing heat and reducing the lapse rate to approximately 6.5 Kelvin per kilometer.

#### Real-world Examples and Observations
- Temperature variations in mountain regions (e.g., Chamonix, France).
- Weather balloon measurements: Radiosondes provide temperature profiles.

#### Conclusion
- Understanding the lapse rate is crucial for comprehending the greenhouse effect and climate dynamics.
- Practical examples and visualizations help illustrate the concepts.

#### Visual and Practical Demonstrations
- Videos of convection in pots, weather balloons, and temperature profiles in the atmosphere.
- Example of extreme sports (squirrel suit flying) showing temperature changes from high to low altitudes.

### Lecture Notes: Radiative Transfer and Climate Change

#### Introduction
- Emphasized the necessity of understanding radiative transfer before discussing climate change.
- Revisited previous calculations of Earth's temperature, noting inaccuracies when ignoring the atmosphere.

#### Importance of Earth's Atmosphere
- Earth's atmosphere significantly affects temperature calculations.
- Mars and Mercury have negligible atmospheres, making their temperature calculations simpler.

#### Interaction of Atmosphere with Radiation
- Atmosphere interacts with radiation in two primary ways: scattering shortwave radiation and absorbing/emitting longwave radiation.
- **Shortwave Radiation**: Comes from the sun, includes visible light.
  - Scattering evidenced by the sky's blue color (Rayleigh scattering) and the orange appearance of the sun.
  - **Rayleigh Scattering**: Occurs when molecules are much smaller than the wavelength of light, more efficient for shorter wavelengths (blue light).
  - **Mie Scattering**: Occurs with larger particles like cloud droplets, scattering all wavelengths equally, making clouds appear white.

#### Longwave Radiation and the Atmosphere
- **Longwave Radiation**: Emitted by Earth's surface and objects.
  - Evidence for atmospheric interaction with longwave radiation includes the use of infrared thermometers.
  - Infrared thermometers measure emitted radiation and calculate temperature using the Stefan-Boltzmann law.

#### Optical Depth and Atmospheric Emission
- **Optical Depth (τ)**: Measures the opacity of a gas to radiation.
  - **Optically Thick**: Gas is opaque, effectively absorbing or scattering radiation.
  - **Optically Thin**: Gas is transparent, allowing radiation to pass through.
- Equation for optical depth: \(\Delta \tau = k \cdot \rho \cdot \Delta z\)
  - \(k\): Constant depending on gas type and wavelength.
  - \(\rho\): Density of the gas.
  - \(\Delta z\): Distance light travels through the gas.

#### Atmospheric Absorption and Emission
- The atmosphere absorbs and re-emits longwave radiation, crucial for understanding the greenhouse effect.
- Example with infrared thermometer: Measured the temperature of the sky, indicating significant atmospheric emission.

#### Examples and Analogies
- **Flames**: Emit light due to soot particles (solid) rather than gas emission.
- **Earth's Atmosphere**: Emits significant longwave radiation, contributing more radiative power to the surface than the sun.
- **Sun's Atmosphere**: Emission from the photosphere, the tau equals one layer, determines the sun's visible light.

#### Conclusion
- Understanding radiative transfer, including scattering and absorption/emission, is essential for comprehending global warming and climate dynamics.
- Demonstrated with practical examples and the use of infrared thermometers to measure atmospheric emission.

#### Visual and Practical Demonstrations
- Videos of Rayleigh scattering, Mie scattering, and infrared thermometers.
- Close-up video of the sun to illustrate emission from the photosphere.

By grasping these foundational concepts, we build a clearer understanding of the mechanisms behind global warming and the role of Earth's atmosphere in regulating temperature.

### Lecture Notes: Earth's Greenhouse Gases

#### Introduction to the Greenhouse Effect
- **Greenhouse gases**: Earth's "clothing" that keeps the planet warm.
- Objectives: Learn who discovered the greenhouse effect, identify greenhouse gases, and revisit Earth's temperature calculations.

#### Historical Background: Joseph Fourier
- **Joseph Fourier**: Born to humble beginnings, became a renowned mathematician and physicist.
- Known for the **Fourier transform** and the **heat equation**.
- Fourier's Insight (1824):
  - Earth's temperature can be increased by the atmosphere.
  - Shortwave radiation (light from the sun) penetrates the atmosphere easily.
  - Longwave radiation (infrared) faces more resistance, thus trapping heat.
- Fourier's conclusion: The atmosphere acts like clothing, retaining Earth's warmth.

#### Greenhouse Analogy
- Actual greenhouses: Made of glass, trap heat by preventing convection and retaining infrared radiation.
- Earth’s atmosphere functions similarly, trapping heat and maintaining warmth.

#### Greenhouse Effect Demonstration
- Analogy: Tennis player and a machine (the "lobster") serving tennis balls.
  - Without a wall: Tennis player hits one ball back per ball served.
  - With a wall: Half of the balls hit the wall and bounce back, increasing the number of balls the player returns.
  - This represents how greenhouse gases reflect some heat back to Earth, increasing the surface temperature.
- Earth’s surface receives twice as much energy from the atmosphere as from the sun.

#### Historical Background: John Tyndall
- **John Tyndall**: Alpine climber and scientist.
  - Discovered that nitrogen and oxygen are transparent to infrared radiation.
  - Identified greenhouse gases: **Water vapor, carbon dioxide, and methane**.
- Tyndall's experiments: Showed that trace gases absorb and emit longwave radiation.
- Visit to Mer de Glace glacier: Demonstrates the impact of climate change.

#### Revisiting Earth's Temperature Calculation
- **Previous Calculations**: Underestimated Earth's temperature because they did not account for the atmosphere.
- **Greenhouse gases**: Absorb and emit longwave radiation, affecting Earth's temperature balance.
- **Optical Depth (τ)**: Describes the opacity of the atmosphere to radiation.
  - At τ=1, the atmosphere behaves like a surface emitting radiation.
  - Earth's τ=1 level is at approximately 5 km altitude.

#### Correct Temperature Calculation
- **Energy Balance**: Earth's surface receives 238 watts/m² from the sun.
- Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law: \(\sigma T^4\) where \(\sigma\) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.
- **Initial Calculation**: Yielded 255 K (too cold).
- **Correct Interpretation**: 255 K is the temperature at τ=1 (5 km altitude), not the surface.
- **Lapse Rate**: 6.5 K/km, due to convection and latent heat release from water vapor condensation.
- **Surface Temperature Calculation**:
  - \(T_{\text{surface}} = 255 \text{ K} + (6.5 \text{ K/km} \times 5 \text{ km}) = 288 \text{ K}\)

#### Conclusion
- Correctly calculated Earth's surface temperature: 288 K (consistent with observed temperatures).
- Greenhouse gases play a crucial role in maintaining Earth's habitable temperature.
- Joseph Fourier's and John Tyndall's contributions laid the foundation for modern climate science.

By understanding these principles, we gain a deeper insight into how Earth's atmosphere regulates temperature and supports life.

### Lecture Notes: The Discovery of Global Warming

#### Introduction to Global Warming
- **Objective**: Understand the history of the discovery of global warming, distinguishing it from the discovery of the greenhouse effect.
- **Greenhouse Effect**: Fundamental energy balance that keeps Earth warm.
- **Global Warming**: Enhancement of the greenhouse effect due to human activities.

#### Svante Arrhenius and Early Predictions
- **Svante Arrhenius**: Father of modern physical chemistry and Nobel Prize winner.
- **Arrhenius' Work (1896)**:
  - First calculation of Earth's climate sensitivity.
  - Defined climate sensitivity as the change in mean global temperature for a doubling of atmospheric CO2 (e.g., from 280 ppm to 560 ppm).
  - Arrhenius calculated a climate sensitivity of 5 Kelvin.
  - Modern estimates place climate sensitivity at around 3 Kelvin, with possible values as high as 5 Kelvin.

#### Understanding Climate Sensitivity
- **Climate Sensitivity**: Change in global mean temperature for a doubling of atmospheric CO2.
- **Mean (Average)**: Sum of values divided by the number of values.
- **PPM (Parts Per Million)**: A unit representing one part in a million.
  - Example: 280 ppm means 280 CO2 molecules per million air molecules.

#### The Importance of Doubling CO2
- **Why Doubling?**:
  - Doubling CO2 is a convenient measure and will happen soon.
  - Each doubling of CO2 leads to a roughly constant increase in temperature.
- **Geometric Increase**: Each doubling results in a linear increase in temperature.
  - Example: From 280 ppm to 560 ppm increases temperature by 3K; from 560 ppm to 1120 ppm increases temperature by another 3K.

#### Dave Keeling and CO2 Measurements
- **Charles David Keeling**: 30-year-old postdoc who started precise measurements of CO2.
- **Mauna Loa Observatory**: Keeling chose this site for its isolation from direct human activity.
- **Keeling Curve**: Shows annual cycles and a long-term increase in atmospheric CO2.
- **Ralph Keeling**: Continued his father's work, including measuring atmospheric oxygen.

#### The Charney Report (1979)
- **Jule Charney**: Professor at MIT, chaired the 1979 Charney Report.
- **Report Findings**: Predicted a climate sensitivity of 1.5 to 4.5 degrees Celsius, with a most likely value near 3 degrees Celsius.
- **Modern Estimates**: Consistent with the Charney Report, climate sensitivity remains estimated at around 3 degrees Celsius.

#### Public Awareness: James Hansen's 1988 Testimony
- **James Hansen**: Director of NASA GISS, testified before Congress in 1988.
- **Key Points from Testimony**:
  - The Earth was warmer in 1988 than at any time in recorded history.
  - Global warming could be confidently linked to the greenhouse effect.
  - Climate simulations predicted an increase in extreme events due to global warming.

#### Conclusion
- **Historical Understanding**: The concept of global warming has been understood for over a century.
- **Current Context**: Rising CO2 emissions continue to drive global warming, validating early predictions and highlighting the ongoing need for action.

### Lecture Notes: Forcing and Feedback in the Context of Global Warming

#### Introduction to Equilibrium
- **Static Equilibrium**: 
  - No flows in or out.
  - The level of stock (e.g., water in a container) remains constant.
- **Steady-State Equilibrium**:
  - Continuous flows in and out, but they are balanced.
  - The stock remains constant over time, but dynamic processes are occurring.

#### Flows and Stocks
- **Flow**: The rate of stuff entering or leaving a system.
  - Examples: Gallons per minute, dollars per year, calories per day.
- **Stock**: The amount of stuff in the system at any given time.
  - Examples: Volume of water, bank account balance, body weight.
- **Steady-State**: Achieved when the total inflow equals the total outflow.

#### Feedback Mechanisms
- **Feedback**: Natural processes that respond to perturbations (changes in the system).
- **Perturbation**: A deviation from the steady-state stock.
  - Can be positive (increase in stock) or negative (decrease in stock).
- **Negative Feedback**:
  - Tends to reduce the size of perturbations.
  - Examples: Increased water outflow with higher water level, spending more when bank balance is high.
- **Positive Feedback**:
  - Tends to increase the size of perturbations.
  - Examples: Interest on savings increasing balance, amplifying initial changes.

#### Feedback Parameter
- **Definition**: Change in net inflow per change in stock.
  - Units: (Units of flow) / (Units of stock).
- **Application**: Helps quantify how a system responds to changes.

#### Forcing
- **Definition**: An externally applied change in the flows.
  - Positive Forcing: Increases the stock (e.g., adding a water hose).
  - Negative Forcing: Decreases the stock (e.g., pumping water out).

#### New Steady-State with Negative Feedback
- A system with negative feedback will reach a new steady-state when subjected to a forcing.
- **Equation**: Final Perturbation = Forcing / Absolute Value of Feedback Parameter.

#### Practical Examples
- **Bank Account**:
  - Positive Feedback: Interest.
  - Negative Feedback: Spending habits based on account balance.
  - Example Calculation: Small raise leading to a new steady-state balance.
- **Body Weight**:
  - Feedback Parameter from literature: Approximately -10 calories/day/pound.
  - Example Calculation: Weight gain from eating two additional Oreo cookies per day (100 calories).

#### Application to Global Warming
- The same principles of forcing and feedback can be applied to the Earth's climate system.
- **Next Steps**: Using these concepts to understand the Earth's energy balance and temperature changes due to global warming.

### Summary
Understanding the concepts of equilibrium, forcing, and feedback is crucial for analyzing dynamic systems, including global warming. By quantifying feedback parameters and identifying forcings, we can predict how systems respond to changes and reach new steady-states.

### Lecture Notes: Understanding the Global Warming Process

#### Refresher from Last Lecture
1. **Key Terms**
   - **Perturbation**: Deviation from the steady-state stock, can be positive or negative.
   - **Forcing**: Externally applied change in flows, can be positive (increases stock) or negative (decreases stock).
   - **Feedbacks**: System's natural responses to perturbations, can amplify (positive feedback) or dampen (negative feedback) the perturbations.

2. **Application of Terms**
   - **Heated House Example**: 
     - **Perturbation**: Opening the door and letting cold air in briefly.
     - **Feedback**: Thermostat acting as a negative feedback to stabilize temperature.
     - **Forcing**: Starting a fire in the fireplace, adding a new heat flow into the system.

#### Understanding Global Warming
1. **Pre-Industrial Earth**
   - Earth was in a steady-state with energy flows in balance.
   - Flow in from the Sun equaled flow out emitted by the Earth's atmosphere.

2. **Impact of Increased Greenhouse Gases**
   - **Optical Depth Equation**: Δτ = k * ρ * Δz
     - Increasing greenhouse gases increases the density (ρ) and raises the tau = 1 surface higher in the atmosphere.
   - **Lapse Rate**: Temperature decreases with height in the atmosphere.
   - **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: Emission flux is proportional to temperature to the fourth power.

3. **Mechanism of Global Warming**
   - Increased CO2 pushes the tau = 1 surface higher, where it is colder.
   - A colder tau = 1 surface emits less radiation, reducing the outgoing power.
   - This imbalance (constant inflow, reduced outflow) results in a net positive inflow and warming.

4. **Radiative Forcing**
   - Doubling CO2 generates a radiative forcing of about 3 watts per square meter.
   - Equivalent to running 50 mini LED Christmas lights per square meter on Earth continuously.

5. **Equilibrium and Feedbacks**
   - Earth’s natural feedback mechanisms eventually lead to a new steady-state.
   - Negative feedbacks stabilize the system, ensuring it doesn't run away to extreme temperatures.

#### Quantifying Earth’s Feedbacks
1. **Total Feedback Parameter**: Sum of individual feedbacks.
   - **Plank Feedback**: Largest negative feedback, based on Stefan-Boltzmann Law.
   - **Lapse Rate Feedback**: Negative feedback, lapse rate decreases as the planet warms.
   - **Water Vapor Feedback**: Positive feedback, warmer air holds more water vapor, enhancing greenhouse effect.
   - **Cloud Feedback**: Positive feedback, fewer low clouds as the planet warms, reducing albedo.
   - **Ice-Albedo Feedback**: Positive feedback, less ice and snow as the planet warms, reducing albedo.

2. **Total Feedback Parameter**: Approximately -1 watt per square meter per Kelvin.
   - Ensures Earth’s climate is stable, though it still warms in response to forcings.

#### Calculating Climate Sensitivity
1. **Climate Sensitivity Definition**: Change in global mean temperature for a doubling of CO2.
   - Forcing from doubling CO2: 3 watts per square meter.
   - Earth's feedback parameter: -1 watt per square meter per Kelvin.

2. **Final Perturbation Calculation**:
   - Final perturbation = Forcing / Absolute value of feedback parameter.
   - 3 watts per square meter / 1 watt per square meter per Kelvin = 3 Kelvin.

#### Conclusion
- By understanding radiative transfer, feedbacks, and steady-state concepts, we can predict that doubling CO2 results in an approximate increase of 3 Kelvin in Earth’s temperature. This foundational knowledge allows us to better comprehend and address the challenges of global warming.

### Lecture: Cloud Taxonomy - Naming the Clouds

#### Motivation for Learning Cloud Types

Understanding clouds is crucial because clouds significantly impact Earth's feedback parameter, which in turn affects climate sensitivity. The largest uncertainty in predicting Earth's climate sensitivity, which ranges from 1.5 to 4.5 Kelvin, comes from our incomplete understanding of clouds.

### Summary

This lecture provided an overview of cloud taxonomy, emphasizing the importance of understanding clouds to improve our predictions of Earth's climate sensitivity. By learning to identify different types of clouds, you can better appreciate the complexity and beauty of the atmosphere in everyday life.

### Lecture: The Origins of Fossil Fuels

Today, we aim to understand where fossil fuels come from, who made them, why they are there, and what they are made of. Before delving into the origins of fossil fuels, let's revisit the question of what causes the seasonal cycle in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2).

#### The Seasonal Cycle of CO2

- **Dave Keeling**: Measured atmospheric CO2 at Mauna Loa, revealing the longest continuous record of CO2 levels and discovering the seasonal cycle in CO2 concentration.

##### Photosynthesis and Respiration

- **Photosynthesis**: Plants use sunlight to convert CO2 and H2O into organic matter (CH2O) and release O2.
- **Respiration**: Opposite of photosynthesis; organisms break down organic matter (CH2O) to release CO2 and H2O.

The carbon cycle involves moving carbon between atmospheric CO2 and organic matter through these processes.

#### Causes of the Seasonal Cycle

- **Summer**: Photosynthesis > Respiration; CO2 is absorbed from the atmosphere.
- **Winter**: Respiration > Photosynthesis; CO2 is released into the atmosphere.

The cycle is more pronounced in the Northern Hemisphere due to its larger landmass and vegetation.

#### Formation of Fossil Fuels

Fossil fuels originate from organic matter that accumulated over millions of years under specific conditions. There are three main types of fossil fuels:

1. **Coal**: Formed from ancient plant material in swamps.
2. **Oil**: Formed from ancient plankton in marine environments.
3. **Natural Gas (CH4)**: Formed from overcooked oil.

#### Units of Time in Geology

- **Gya**: Billion years ago
- **Mya**: Million years ago
- **Kya**: Thousand years ago

### Earth's Timeline

- **Formation of Earth**: 4.5 billion years ago
- **Formation of Fossil Fuels**: Between 100 and 300 million years ago

### Formation of Coal

Coal is fossilized peat from ancient swamps. During the Carboniferous period (360 to 300 million years ago), conditions favored the accumulation of peat, which eventually transformed into coal under high pressure and temperature.

### Formation of Oil and Natural Gas

Oil and gas come from ancient plankton. When these organisms died, they settled on the sea floor in anoxic conditions, preventing decomposition. Over millions of years, heat and pressure transformed this organic matter into oil and gas.

#### Tethys Sea

- **Oil Formation**: The Tethys Sea, present during the Jurassic period, was a significant site for oil formation.

### Key Points on Fossil Fuels

- **Coal**: Derived from ancient plant material in swamps, primarily from the Carboniferous period.
- **Oil**: Derived from ancient plankton, primarily from the Jurassic period.
- **Natural Gas**: Derived from overcooked oil.

### Conclusion

Understanding the origins of fossil fuels highlights the enormous timescales involved in their formation and the complex processes that have led to their accumulation. Fossil fuels, essential for modern civilization, are ancient and finite resources. Recognizing their origins underscores the importance of managing and transitioning away from these non-renewable energy sources.

### Next Steps

We'll delve further into the implications of fossil fuel use and explore alternative energy sources in upcoming lectures. See you next time!

### Lecture: Drill, Baby, Drill - The Impact of Fossil Fuels

Today's lecture focuses on the phrase "Drill, baby, drill," popularized at the 2008 Republican Convention. This encapsulates the longstanding attitude toward fossil fuel extraction in the United States over the past 150 years. We'll examine the empirical formulas for different types of fossil fuels and track the movement of carbon atoms through the Earth's system, emphasizing the importance of accounting for carbon in our understanding of global warming.

#### Types of Fossil Fuels
- **Coal**: Empirical formula - C or CH
- **Oil**: Empirical formula - CH2
- **Natural Gas**: Empirical formula - CH4

#### Units for Measuring Carbon
- **Gigatons of Carbon (GTC)**: The mass of carbon is easier to track than the mass of CO2.
- **Conversion**: 1 GTC = 3.7 gigatons of CO2

#### Pre-Industrial Carbon Stocks
- **Atmosphere**: 600 GTC
- **Land Plants**: 500 GTC
- **Soils**: 1500 GTC
- **Ocean**: 40,000 GTC (mostly irrelevant for global warming as it is dissolved CO2 in steady-state balance)

#### Fossil Fuel Carbon Stocks
- **Coal**: 5,000 GTC
- **Gas**: 250 GTC
- **Oil**: 350 GTC

#### Fossil Fuel Consumption to Date
- **Coal**: 200 GTC
- **Oil**: 150 GTC
- **Gas**: 50 GTC

### Carbon Distribution and Emissions
- **Current distribution**:
  - Atmosphere: 250 GTC
  - Ocean: 150 GTC

#### Converting Gigatons to PPM
- **1 ppm of CO2**: Approximately 2 GTC
- **Current Increase**: 250 GTC added to the atmosphere since the pre-industrial era increases CO2 concentration by approximately 120 ppm, leading to a current concentration of around 420 ppm.

### Fossil Fuel Usage Per Person
- **Average American Usage**: 
  - Coal: 3 tons/year
  - Oil: 22 barrels/year
  - Natural Gas: 2400 cubic meters/year

#### Global CO2 Emissions
- **Current Emissions**: About 10 GTC/year
- **Atmospheric Increase**: Approximately 2.5 ppm/year

### Future Projections
- **Happy Scenario**:
  - Population remains at 7 billion
  - Global CO2 increases by 2 ppm/year
  - In 100 years, CO2 concentration reaches 600 ppm (more than double pre-industrial levels).

- **Unhappy Scenario**:
  - Population reaches 10 billion
  - Everyone uses fossil fuels at the rate of the average American
  - CO2 increases by 8 ppm/year
  - In 100 years, CO2 concentration reaches 1500 ppm (more than quadruple pre-industrial levels).

### Reality Check
- **Business as Usual**: Projected CO2 concentration of around 1000 ppm by 2100, which implies a significant rise in global temperatures.

### Implications and Responsibility
- **Historical Comparison**: Just as society has judged past practices like slavery, future generations will likely judge our current reliance on fossil fuels.
- **Personal Responsibility**: While we all contribute to fossil fuel consumption, it is crucial to advocate for sustainable practices and policies to mitigate climate change.

### Conclusion
The "Drill, baby, drill" attitude has led to significant increases in atmospheric CO2, with severe implications for global warming. Understanding the sources, consumption, and future projections of fossil fuel use is essential for addressing climate change effectively.

I'll see you next time.

### Lecture: Evidence of Global Warming

#### Introduction
Today, we'll explore various lines of evidence that demonstrate global warming is happening and identify its causes. We'll look at the following key indicators:

1. Tropical glaciers
2. Borehole temperatures
3. Surface air thermometers
4. Satellite measurements

#### Tropical Glaciers

**Overview:**
- Tropical glaciers exist at high altitudes in the tropics, where the lapse rate (6.5 K/km) allows freezing temperatures.
- These glaciers provide historical climate records through ice cores.

**Lani Thompson’s Research:**
- Lani Thompson from Ohio State University has studied tropical glaciers for decades.
- His work involves extracting ice cores, which provide valuable climate data, including temperature records and atmospheric composition over time.
- Example: His research in the Andes has shown significant glacier retreat, indicating rising temperatures.

**Fieldwork:**
- Collecting ice cores is logistically challenging due to harsh conditions, the need for solar-powered equipment, and transportation difficulties to keep samples frozen.

#### Borehole Temperatures

**Concept:**
- Boreholes, drilled for mining or oil exploration, can be used to measure historical temperatures.
- Temperature profiles in boreholes show how temperatures at the surface have changed over time.

**Methodology:**
- Thermometers are lowered into boreholes to measure temperature at various depths.
- Seasonal temperature variations are observed near the surface, while deeper measurements reflect longer-term changes.

**Findings:**
- Corrected borehole data shows a clear warming trend of about 1 K compared to pre-industrial temperatures.
- This evidence is consistent across various studies and locations, such as India.

#### Surface Air Thermometers

**Technology:**
- Surface air temperatures are measured using Stevenson screens, which protect thermometers from direct sunlight and allow for air circulation.
- These devices have been in use since 1864, ensuring long-term consistency in temperature records.

**Historical Data:**
- The Blue Hills Observatory in Massachusetts has the longest continuous record of temperature in the US.
- Analysis of this data shows a clear warming trend of about 2 K since the late 1800s.

**Local Example:**
- Berkeley, California, has recorded September temperatures showing a significant upward trend.
- This data highlights the local impact of global warming, with temperatures rising by about 2 K.

#### Satellite Measurements

**Technology:**
- Satellites equipped with the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) measure atmospheric temperatures by detecting microwave emissions.
- These measurements provide a global view and cover various altitudes in the atmosphere.

**Radiative Transfer:**
- Different wavelengths correspond to emissions from different atmospheric layers.
- AMSU channels sample various heights, providing a vertical temperature profile.

**Findings:**
- Satellite data shows warming in the troposphere (lower atmosphere) and cooling in the stratosphere (upper atmosphere).
- This pattern is consistent with the increased greenhouse effect, where more CO2 leads to more efficient cooling in the stratosphere while warming the troposphere.

#### Conclusion

Multiple lines of evidence confirm that global warming is occurring and is driven by increased greenhouse gases. This includes direct measurements from tropical glaciers, borehole temperatures, surface air thermometers, and satellite data. The comprehensive nature of these findings provides robust support for the reality and causes of global warming.

#### Questions and Discussion

Feel free to ask any questions about today's lecture or share your thoughts on the evidence presented. Let's discuss how we can further understand and address global warming.

### Lecture: Ocean Acidification and Timescales of Carbon Dioxide Removal

#### Introduction
Today, we explore ocean acidification, its implications for global warming, and the timescales involved in removing excess CO2 from the atmosphere. 

#### Ocean Acidification

**Overview:**
- When CO2 is released into the atmosphere, a significant portion dissolves into the ocean.
- This process is similar to carbonating water to make seltzer, where CO2 is dissolved in water, creating carbonic acid.

**Carbonate Chemistry:**
- CO2 dissolves in water, forming carbonic acid (H2CO3).
- Carbonic acid dissociates into bicarbonate (HCO3-) and hydrogen ions (H+), increasing ocean acidity.
- Increased acidity negatively impacts marine life, particularly organisms that rely on calcium carbonate for their shells and skeletons.

**Calcium Carbonate and Marine Life:**
- Calcium carbonate (CaCO3) forms the shells of many marine organisms, such as corals and sea butterflies.
- Increased acidity dissolves existing calcium carbonate and makes it harder for organisms to form new shells.

**Implications for Marine Ecosystems:**
- The dissolution of calcium carbonate disrupts marine ecosystems, potentially leading to the collapse of the food web.

#### Timescales of CO2 Removal

**Definition of Timescale:**
- A timescale is the approximate time it takes for a process to be mostly completed.

**Processes and Timescales:**
1. **Ocean Acidification:**
   - Excess CO2 dissolves in the ocean, forming carbonic acid and increasing acidity.
   - This process equilibrates with the atmosphere over approximately 1000 years.
   - About 60% of the excess CO2 will be stored in the ocean.

2. **Dissolution of Calcium Carbonate:**
   - Over about 10,000 years, calcium carbonate from the ocean floor dissolves, neutralizing acidity and allowing more CO2 to be stored in the ocean.
   - This process removes an additional 20% of the excess CO2.

3. **Silicate Weathering:**
   - Rainwater containing dissolved CO2 weathers silicate rocks, producing calcium ions and carbonate ions that eventually form new calcium carbonate in the ocean.
   - This process takes about 100,000 years to remove the remaining CO2 from the atmosphere.

**Implications for Global Warming:**
- Even with these processes, 20% of the burned carbon may remain in the atmosphere, sustaining elevated temperatures.
- The slow nature of these processes means that CO2 emissions today will impact the climate for tens of thousands of years.

#### Conclusion

Understanding the timescales of CO2 removal highlights the long-term impact of our current fossil fuel consumption. Immediate action is crucial to mitigate the lasting effects on our climate and ecosystems.

### Lecture: The IPCC and Its Role in Climate Science

#### Introduction
Today we're going to discuss the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), an essential body in understanding and addressing climate change. To start, let's take a look at the history leading up to the IPCC.

#### Early Weather Forecasting

**1857 Washington D.C.:**
- No satellites, phones, or computers. Weather prediction relied on the telegraph, enabling long-distance communication.
- Storms generally move from west to east across the U.S. This knowledge, combined with telegraph communication, allowed for the first weather forecasts.

**Joseph Henry's Contribution:**
- Joseph Henry of the Smithsonian set up a weather map in the lobby of the Smithsonian in 1857.
- Using telegraph reports, he updated the map with weather conditions across the U.S., effectively creating an early version of the National Weather Service.

**European Efforts:**
- In 1872, Buys Ballot proposed an international network of weather stations across Europe.
- By 1873, an organization was established to exchange weather data between European countries.
- This organization became the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) in 1950, part of the United Nations.

#### Environmental Awareness and Action

**Polio Epidemic and DDT:**
- In the 1950s, the U.S. faced a polio epidemic, leading to the widespread use of DDT to control mosquitoes, mistakenly thought to be vectors for polio.
- DDT proved harmful to wildlife, particularly raptors, leading to near extinction of species like the bald eagle and peregrine falcon.

**Rachel Carson’s "Silent Spring":**
- Published in 1962, Carson's book highlighted the environmental damage caused by chemicals like DDT.
- "Silent Spring" was pivotal in igniting the environmental movement of the 1960s and 1970s.

**Legislative Impact:**
- The environmental movement led to significant U.S. environmental laws: NEPA, the Clean Air Act, the establishment of the EPA, the Clean Water Act, and the Endangered Species Act.

**United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP):**
- Founded in 1972, UNEP played a crucial role in environmental protection, including the Montreal Protocol, which addressed ozone layer depletion.

#### Formation and Work of the IPCC

**1988: A Pivotal Year:**
- James Hansen's congressional testimony on global warming raised public awareness.
- The WMO and UNEP, leveraging their expertise in weather, climate, and environmental impacts, founded the IPCC.

**IPCC Assessment Reports:**
- The first report was published in 1990, and reports continue to be released every 4-6 years.
- Each report consists of three volumes, written by hundreds of scientists worldwide, reviewed by all UN member nations.

**Working Groups:**
1. **Working Group I:** Focuses on the physical science of climate change.
2. **Working Group II:** Addresses impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability.
3. **Working Group III:** Deals with mitigation strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

#### Notable Achievements

**Nobel Peace Prize:**
- In 2007, the IPCC and Al Gore jointly received the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts to increase knowledge and lay the foundation for measures against climate change.

**Iconic Graphs and Findings:**
- One of the most significant contributions is the radiative forcing graph, which illustrates the various factors contributing to global warming.
- The graph highlights the impact of greenhouse gases like CO2 and methane, as well as aerosols and other factors.

**Radiative Forcing:**
- Radiative forcing refers to the change in energy balance in the Earth's atmosphere due to greenhouse gases and other factors.
- CO2 is the largest contributor to positive radiative forcing, primarily from fossil fuel combustion.
- Methane, though less abundant, has a significant short-term impact due to its high radiative forcing potential.

#### Conclusion

The IPCC plays a crucial role in summarizing the state of climate science and informing global policy. Its reports provide a comprehensive overview of the scientific consensus on climate change, its impacts, and possible mitigation strategies. By understanding the work of the IPCC, we can better grasp the challenges and solutions in addressing climate change.

### Lecture: Other Gases and Their Forcing on Earth

#### Introduction
Today, we're going to continue our discussion on the gases that contribute to Earth's radiative forcing due to human activity. We've already covered carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). Now, we'll explore other gases that cause both positive and negative forcing, including nitrous oxide (N2O), ozone (O3), and halocarbons. 

#### Nitrous Oxide (N2O)
- **Sources:** Primarily from agriculture, specifically the use of nitrogen fertilizers.
- **Chemical Structure:** N2O consists of two nitrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.
- **Usage:** Also known as "laughing gas," used in medical settings for anesthesia and as a propellant in whipped cream dispensers.
- **Impact:** Potent greenhouse gas with a high radiative forcing per molecule, contributing significantly to positive forcing.

#### Ozone (O3)
- **Formation:** Created in the lower atmosphere (troposphere) through chemical reactions involving nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the presence of sunlight.
- **Sources:** NOx and VOCs come from combustion processes, especially in urban areas.
- **Impact:** Ozone is beneficial in the stratosphere for blocking UV radiation but harmful in the troposphere due to health impacts and its role as a greenhouse gas.

#### Halocarbons
- **Chemical Structure:** Carbon atoms bonded with halogen atoms (chlorine, fluorine).
- **Examples:** Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), and Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs).
- **Uses:** Refrigerants in air conditioners, blowing agents in foam production, and formerly in aerosol propellants.
- **Impact:** Extremely high radiative forcing per molecule and long atmospheric lifetimes, making them significant contributors to global warming despite lower concentrations.

#### Aerosols
- **Definition:** Fine solid or liquid particles suspended in the air, not related to aerosol spray cans.
- **Types:** Natural aerosols (volcanic ash, pollen, sea salt, soot) and anthropogenic aerosols (sulfate aerosols from burning fossil fuels).
- **Impact:** Sulfate aerosols reflect sunlight, causing a negative forcing that cools the planet. However, their effect is relatively short-lived compared to greenhouse gases.

#### Summary of Forcing Agents
- **Positive Forcing Agents:** CO2, CH4, N2O, O3, and halocarbons, collectively causing about 3 watts per square meter of positive forcing.
- **Negative Forcing Agents:** Aerosols, causing about -1 watt per square meter of negative forcing.

#### Calculating Earth’s Warming
- **Total Forcing:** Net forcing is approximately 2 watts per square meter (positive forcing minus negative forcing).
- **Feedback Parameter:** Earth's feedback parameter is approximately -1 watt per square meter per Kelvin.
- **Resulting Temperature Increase:** 
  \[ \Delta T = \frac{\Delta F}{|\lambda|} = \frac{2 \, \text{W/m}^2}{1 \, \text{W/m}^2/\text{K}} = 2 \, \text{K} \]
  - This means Earth should theoretically warm by 2 Kelvin. However, the observed warming is currently about 1 Kelvin, indicating that we haven't yet reached a new equilibrium.

#### Future Projections
- **Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs):** Scenarios predicting future radiative forcing by 2100.
  - **RCP 2.6:** Optimistic scenario with significant mitigation efforts.
  - **RCP 8.5:** Business-as-usual scenario with continued high emissions.
- **Temperature Projections:** 
  - **RCP 2.6:** Global temperature increase limited to around 2 Kelvin.
  - **RCP 8.5:** Global temperature increase of about 4 Kelvin by 2100, with even higher increases in the Arctic and over land.

#### Conclusion
Understanding the various gases contributing to Earth's radiative forcing and their sources helps us comprehend the complexity of climate change. While CO2 remains the most significant contributor, other gases like CH4, N2O, O3, and halocarbons also play crucial roles. The future of our planet's climate depends on our actions today, and the scenarios outlined by the IPCC highlight the urgent need for effective mitigation strategies.

### Lecture: Scary Carbon Feedbacks and Potential Burning

#### Introduction
Today's lecture delves into the alarming feedback mechanisms related to carbon that could significantly amplify global warming. We'll explore how certain natural systems, when disturbed by human activities, can release additional carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) into the atmosphere, creating a self-reinforcing cycle of warming. The main topics we'll cover are:

1. Peat
2. Permafrost
3. Clathrates

#### Peat
- **What is Peat?**
  - Peat is an accumulation of partially decayed vegetation or organic matter, found in waterlogged conditions.
  - It contains significant amounts of carbon because the wet conditions prevent complete decomposition.
  
- **Distribution and Importance:**
  - Peatlands are found in high latitude regions like Siberia, Canada, and parts of Europe, as well as in tropical regions.
  - Peatlands account for about 200 gigatons of carbon down to one meter in soil.

- **Impact of Warming:**
  - Increased temperatures accelerate the evaporation of water from peatlands due to the Clausius-Clapeyron equation.
  - As peat dries out, it becomes susceptible to burning.
  - Peat fires release large amounts of CO2 and can contribute significantly to atmospheric carbon. For example, the 1997 peat fires in Indonesia released more CO2 than the European Union's annual emissions.

#### Permafrost
- **What is Permafrost?**
  - Permafrost is soil that remains frozen throughout the year.
  - It exists in regions where the mean annual temperature is below freezing, typically found in the Arctic.

- **Structure and Thawing:**
  - The active layer of permafrost thaws in summer and refreezes in winter.
  - Below the active layer is the permafrost, which can extend hundreds of meters deep.
  
- **Carbon Content and Thawing Impact:**
  - Permafrost contains about 350 gigatons of carbon down to one meter and up to 1500 gigatons at all depths.
  - Warming temperatures lead to thawing permafrost, causing the release of CO2 and CH4 as organic matter decomposes.
  - Methane released from thawing permafrost is especially concerning due to its high global warming potential.

- **Visible Effects:**
  - Thawing permafrost destabilizes the ground, causing infrastructure damage in Arctic communities.
  - Satellite images show widespread lake disappearance in Siberia, indicating permafrost melt.

#### Clathrates
- **What are Clathrates?**
  - Clathrates are crystalline structures of water that trap gas molecules, particularly methane, within their lattice.
  - Methane clathrates look like ice but can burn, releasing methane.

- **Distribution and Risk:**
  - Methane clathrates are found in ocean sediments, especially along continental margins.
  - Estimates of carbon stored in methane clathrates range from 1000 to 10,000 gigatons.

- **Impact of Warming:**
  - Warming ocean temperatures can destabilize methane clathrates, releasing methane into the water and eventually into the atmosphere.
  - This release can significantly amplify global warming, as methane is a potent greenhouse gas.

- **Economic Interest:**
  - Some see methane clathrates as a potential energy source. However, exploiting these reserves would exacerbate climate change.

#### Conclusion
These carbon feedback mechanisms represent a critical area of concern in our understanding of climate change. The potential release of vast amounts of carbon from peat, permafrost, and clathrates could drive global temperatures even higher, creating a cycle that is increasingly difficult to control. This underscores the urgency of reducing human-induced CO2 emissions and mitigating climate change to prevent triggering these dangerous feedbacks.

### Key Takeaways
1. **Peatlands:** Drying due to increased temperatures can lead to significant carbon release through fires.
2. **Permafrost:** Thawing releases both CO2 and CH4, destabilizing the ground and contributing to further warming.
3. **Clathrates:** Ocean warming could release large amounts of methane from clathrates, with devastating climate impacts.

We must act swiftly to address climate change and prevent these natural feedback mechanisms from exacerbating the situation.

### Lecture: Paleoclimate and Future Climate Scenarios

#### Introduction
Today, we're delving into paleoclimate, the study of Earth's ancient climates. By understanding past climates, we can gain insights into what the future may hold. We'll explore the four basic climate states that a planet like Earth can experience:

1. Snowball Earth
2. Icehouse
3. Hothouse
4. Runaway Greenhouse

We'll examine each state, how they form, and their implications for Earth.

#### Four Climate States
1. **Snowball Earth:**
   - **Definition:** Oceans frozen from the poles to the equator.
   - **Appearance:** Earth would appear as a giant snowball from space.
   - **Habitability:** Completely uninhabitable for advanced life forms.
   - **Historical Occurrence:** Earth experienced Snowball Earth events during the Precambrian eon.

2. **Icehouse:**
   - **Definition:** Permanent ice at the poles, such as ice sheets.
   - **Appearance:** Similar to today's Earth, with large ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica.
   - **Habitability:** Habitable but colder than other climate states.
   - **Current Climate:** Earth's present climate is an icehouse climate.

3. **Hothouse:**
   - **Definition:** No permanent ice at the poles.
   - **Appearance:** Warmer global temperatures with no polar ice.
   - **Habitability:** Habitable but much warmer than current conditions.
   - **Historical Occurrence:** Earth has been in a hothouse climate during parts of the Mesozoic era.

4. **Runaway Greenhouse:**
   - **Definition:** Positive feedbacks cause uncontrollable warming, boiling away oceans.
   - **Appearance:** Extremely hot, with a dense CO2 atmosphere.
   - **Habitability:** Completely uninhabitable.
   - **Example:** Venus is an example of a planet in a runaway greenhouse state.

#### Earth's Climate History
- **Precambrian Eon:** Includes Snowball Earth events triggered by factors such as the Great Oxygenation Event.
- **Phanerozoic Eon:** Marked by multicellular life, divided into three eras:
  - **Paleozoic (Old Life):** Age of weird critters, ended 251 million years ago with the Great Dying.
  - **Mesozoic (Middle Life):** Age of dinosaurs, ended 65 million years ago with an asteroid impact.
  - **Cenozoic (New Life):** Age of mammals, continues to present day.

#### Endotherms vs. Ectotherms
- **Ectotherms:** Rely on external heat sources to regulate body temperature. Efficient but less active in cold conditions.
- **Endotherms:** Generate internal heat to maintain body temperature. Require more energy but remain active in cold conditions.

#### Climate and Life
- **Mesozoic Climate:** Warm, hothouse conditions favored ectotherms like dinosaurs.
- **Cenozoic Climate:** Cooler, icehouse conditions favored endotherms like mammals.
- **Future Climate:** Business-as-usual scenarios may push Earth back towards a hothouse climate, impacting ecosystems and biodiversity.

#### Conclusion
Understanding paleoclimate helps us predict future climate scenarios and their potential impacts. Our current trajectory, if unchanged, could lead to drastic changes, reminiscent of past hothouse conditions. This knowledge underscores the urgency of addressing climate change to avoid severe and possibly irreversible consequences.
