## Prompt Response

- What Areas of STEAM interest you and why?
	- Technology
		- I'm particularly interested in how technology can solve complex problems and simplify life. The integration of artificial intelligence in daily life fascinates me, from virtual assistants to advanced robotics.
		- Furthermore, I am deeply interested in how technological advancements are driving modern data science, enabling us to glean insightful and predictive patterns from large datasets that would not have been possible just a few decades ago.
	- Mathematics
		- The universal language of mathematics captivates me because it forms the foundation for all STEAM disciplines. I appreciate the precision, logic, and creativity required to solve complex equations.
		- Mathematics' applicability to real-world problems, from modeling climate change to optimizing logistics and supply chain management, intrigues me. Using mathematics to address societal challenges demonstrates the field's profound relevance.
		- Mathematics is a profound subject and an excellent tool for computer science. Cryptography, LLMs, Neural Networks, Gen AI, and many other tools we see nowadays depend on advanced mathematics like matrices and graph theory.

- What motivates you to become a leader in a STEAM field?
	- My motivation is driven by the possibility of contributing to societal development through innovative and practical solutions. I believe that STEAM fields are the future of global growth and can have a direct positive impact on people's lives.
	- I also see leadership in STEAM as a platform for encouraging others, particularly those from underrepresented groups, to participate and excel in these fields.


- What Intrigues you about the work of the CIA? How would you integrate STEAM into the CIA's mission
	- Mission of the CIA:
		- Collect intelligence that matters
		- Produce objective all-source analysis
		- Safeguard the secrets that help keep the United States safe
		- Provide accurate, comprehensive, and timely foreign intelligence related to national security
		- Conduct counterintelligence activities, special activities, and other functions related to foreign intelligence and national security as directed by the President
		- Collect intelligence through human sources and by other appropriate means
		- Correlate and evaluate intelligence related to national security and provide appropriate dissemination of such intelligence
		- Collect, analyze, evaluate, and disseminate foreign intelligence
	- How generative AI can disrupt the CIA's Mission
		- THREAT: Generated evidence can dismantle or misdirect investigative efforts
			- Misinformation/Fake News
			- Falsified Testimonies
		- Misinformation can disrupt governments, communities, and global partnerships/delicate political balance 
			- Destabilizing Governments through falsified videos/documents
		- OPPORTUNITY: AI can also filter and process vast amounts of data in short periods
			- identifying potential threats more efficiently than traditional methods.
			- producing analysis on large sets of data in time-dependent situations
		- OPPORTUNITY: AI-driven cybersecurity measures could fortify the CIA's infrastructure, making it harder for adversaries to breach the agency's systems.
	- Integration of STEAM into the CIA's mission
		- Enhancing analytical capabilities by using AI algorithms to interpret complex data, increasing efficiency and effectiveness.
		- Leveraging advanced technologies for better communication, cryptography, and cyber defense.
		- Using mathematical models to predict potential global security risks and inform strategy.
		- Working on the next generation of drone-based surveillance systems that bring together computer vision, robotics, etc.,


- School STEAM activities in which you participated. Any awards or recognitions?
	- School robotics team
		- Hardware lead across all five teams
		- Wrote software for both autonomous and driver-controlled competitions
		- Qualified and participated in regionals
		- Control Award 1st Place Norcal
		- Inspire Award 1st Place Norcal
		- placed 7th in Norcal overall
	- Refurbish old cars for fun with a group of engineering friends from school
		- Gained practical knowledge of mechanical and electrical systems.
		- Developed problem-solving skills by addressing unique challenges with each project.
		- Fostered teamwork and project management skills.
	- Computer Science
		- Received Rotary Club Scholastic Award for Excellence in Computer Science across 5 Schools in District
		- Many open-source projects (See GitHub linked Below)
		- produce personal models for projects
			- created a space invaders agent through reinforcement learning (also linked below)
