## The Activity and the University

  

### Please explain why you would like to organize this activity in the framework of the University. *

  

Organizing the activity within the framework of the iLEGEND III project by the North-South Centre of the Council of Europe is suitable for several reasons. Firstly, the project's objectives align with the activity's focus on global education, sustainable development, and fostering dialogue. Secondly, the project emphasizes interregional cooperation, making it conducive to engaging with the Maasai tribe in Tanzania and strengthening bonds between different regions. Additionally, the activity contributes to capacity building, advocacy, awareness raising, and partnership development, which are key components of the iLEGEND III project. Overall, organizing the activity within this institutional framework provides an opportunity to address climate change, support indigenous communities, and promote global education effectively.

  

Please explain how your activity is connected to and in which way it contributes to tackling the 2023 annual theme. *

  

Climate change plays a critical role in the water problems faced by the Maasai tribe. As the global climate shifts, the Maasai's traditional water sources, such as rivers, lakes, and natural springs, are becoming increasingly unpredictable and unreliable. Rising temperatures, prolonged droughts, and altered rainfall patterns are disrupting the availability and accessibility of water for the community. This has severe implications for their economic activities, as water scarcity limits agricultural productivity, livestock rearing, and other livelihood practices that are integral to their way of life. Additionally, the scarcity of clean and safe water affects the health and well-being of the Maasai people, leading to increased vulnerability to waterborne diseases and malnutrition.

  

Furthermore, climate change worsens the water problem by intensifying competition for limited water resources among various stakeholders, including neighboring communities, commercial interests, and wildlife conservation efforts. This intensification of resource conflicts adds additional pressure on the Maasai's access to water, often disproportionately affecting marginalized communities. By addressing the water challenges within the context of climate change, this project recognizes the interconnectedness of environmental, social, and economic factors. It aims to develop sustainable and adaptive solutions that not only meet the immediate water needs of the Maasai but also consider long-term climate resilience and promote equitable water management practices.

  

Please explain how your organization can contribute to the overall management and coordination of the event for the success of the event.

1. Leaders from Maji Wells and associated organizations can help facilitate other events and workshops.
    
2. Organize a Project Fuel “Life Lessons” activity for the participants. Project Fuel works across projects in Belgium, Finland, the US, India, Tanzania, and many other nations globally.
