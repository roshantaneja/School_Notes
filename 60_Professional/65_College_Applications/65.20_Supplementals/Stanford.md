As a kid, I was fascinated by Pokémon Go. Walking around town with my grandfather, glued to his phone, seeing physical and virtual worlds intertwined. Before I knew it, I was diving into different kinds of maps—exploring how satellites capture terabytes of data daily.

Humanity has always been curious about how the world looks from above. Once an art form carved into stone, cartography evolved into a scientific tool that revolutionized the unexplored world in the 1500s. I poured over map projections, from Mercator’s designs to the grid-based system of what3words. Earth observation technology has been evolving since the dawn of humanity, from maps to satellites, yet despite all our progress, few are pausing to harness its full potential.

A few years later, I was hiking remote terrains to map dwellings in northern Tanzania. It was a grueling ordeal, and that’s when it hit me—why not use satellite data? I used high-resolution imagery to map remote dwellings and pinpoint where reservoirs were needed. It didn’t matter whether I used hyperspectral, infrared, or SAR imagery or whether the data came from satellites, sensors, or both. What mattered was that it addressed a real need, bringing water to over 10,000 people.

Sharing my work at conferences, I’ve learned how high-resolution imagery and advanced computation transform earth observation. We can predict the path of a drifting iceberg to protect ships or even measure economic shifts by analyzing urban activity—things that would have been unimaginable just five years ago.

Humanity has always been curious about how the world looks from above. The Maasai leader’s eyes lit up, “I have never seen a map of my community”. He was seeing 488 black dots on a satellite image spread across 250 sq. miles. I had used high-resolution imagery to map remote dwellings and pinpoint where reservoirs were needed. It didn’t matter whether I used hyperspectral, infrared, or whether the data came from satellites, sensors, or both. What mattered was that it was going to address a real need, bringing water to over 10,000 people.

As a kid, I was fascinated by Pokémon Go. Walking with my grandfather, glued to his phone, seeing physical and virtual worlds intertwined. At first, it was all about how satellites could map my neighborhood and layer digital characters onto real streets. As I spent time in Road Scholars competitions (I won none), I realized these orbiting machines do a lot more—tracking hurricane “Irene”, forest coverage, and monitor oceans.

Fast-forward a few years, and I found myself in Northern Tanzania, working with the Maasai tribe to assess where to place the rainwater solutions as the tribe was spread over 500 sq miles. I started out manually mapping remote villages, often hiking for hours when roads disappeared. One day, my car even toppled into a ditch enroute to one of the locations. That’s when it hit me—why rely on guesswork when I could use satellites to map the terrain and dwelling. I evaluated two open-source satellite data, talked to an expert in satellite imaging, read a few papers, and using available tools from Google and created a heatmap of living locations. This year, 100 rainwater units are being deployed by Dec 2024.

Today, high-resolution imagery and advanced computation can predict the path of a drifting iceberg to protect ships or measure economic shifts by analyzing urban activity—things that would have been unimaginable just five years ago. I believe we can help underserved communities like the Maasai predict the direction of flood saving lives, or forecasting expected food famine based on monitoring vegetation, rainfall, and temperature patterns?

Humanity has always been curious about how the world looks from above. The Maasai leader’s eyes lit up, “I have never seen a map of my community”. He was seeing 488 black dots on a satellite image spread across 250 sq. miles. I had used high-resolution imagery to map remote dwellings and pinpoint where reservoirs were needed. It didn’t matter whether the data came from satellites or sensors; it was immaterial how I had trained a model to locate these coordinates. What mattered was that it was going to address a real need, bringing water to over 10,000 people.

As a kid, I was fascinated by Pokémon Go. Walking with my grandfather, glued to his phone, seeing physical and virtual worlds intertwined, I was awestruck at how satellites could map my neighborhood and layer digital characters onto it. As I spent time in Road Scholars competitions, I realized these behemoths orbiting at 18,000 miles an hour, do a lot more than provide GPS locations and communications. Today satellites are instrumental in climate and weather forecasting and can even detect underground water and mineral resources. 

Fast-forward a few years, and I found myself in Northern Tanzania, working with the Maasai tribe to assess where to place the rainwater solutions. I started out manually mapping remote villages, often hiking for hours. One day, when our car, traversing the unexpected terrain, toppled into a ditch enroute to one of the locations, it hit me—I could use satellites to reach the inner depths of the areas I couldn’t travel to. I evaluated two different open-source satellite datasets, talked to an expert in satellite imaging, took summer classes at UCs, read any papers that I could find online (and understand), and finally created an accurate heatmap of living locations (after several failed attempts). This year, 100 rainwater units are being deployed on those tiny black dots.

Today, high-resolution imagery and advanced computation can predict the path of a drifting iceberg to protect ships or measure economic shifts by analyzing urban activity—things that would have been unimaginable just five years ago. Looking forward, I can’t wait for technology like the UrtheCast high resolution video camera being tested on the ISS, that can track individual vehicles to individual waves on the beach. I want to be able to harness the petabytes of data being collected and turn it into actionable resources for bringing about a new understanding of our planet and better serving the people on it. 
(anyway to tie it back to pokemon)
