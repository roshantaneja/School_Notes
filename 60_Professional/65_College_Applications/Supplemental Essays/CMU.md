Success for me isn’t just about grades or academic achievements; it’s about making a meaningful impact on global issues like water scarcity. My goal is to leverage technology to solve real-world problems, particularly in underserved communities. Through research projects, internships, and collaborations with faculty and peers, I hope to apply the theoretical knowledge I gain at CMU to develop innovative solutions for these challenges.

During my time working with the Maasai tribe in Tanzania, I realized the transformative power of technology in addressing water scarcity. Using satellite imagery and machine learning, I helped deploy 100 rainwater harvesting units in remote areas. This experience showed me that sustainable solutions to resource scarcity require not just technical skills but interdisciplinary collaboration, something CMU excels in.

At CMU, I plan to explore environmental engineering and machine learning through the Environment & Water Resources Institute (EWRI). Working with faculty like Moise Busogi, a leader in machine learning and remote sensing, would provide me with the tools to advance my research in water management. With CMU Engineers Without Borders, I can refine the rainwater harvesting solutions I’ve developed, improving their scalability and efficiency for regions like Northern Tanzania.

One of my key goals is to organize field research trips to Tanzania, where I will prototype and test field/service robots to enhance water access. Through the Sustainability Studio and the African Engineering & Technology Network, I hope to build a collaborative research environment that includes both students and faculty. Together, we can work on water access policy and technology, creating lasting solutions for communities facing similar challenges.

I’m also excited by the research happening at CMU, particularly David Russell’s work, “Using Drones and Remote Sensing to Understand Forests with Limited Ground Truth Data.” His use of technology to address environmental problems aligns perfectly with my goal of using drones, satellite imagery, and machine learning to tackle water scarcity.

Ultimately, I want my time at CMU to be defined by the impact I make, both through the solutions I develop and the collaborations I foster. My hope is to create opportunities for my peers to work alongside me in Tanzania, applying the knowledge we gain in the classroom to improve lives globally.
