Brainstorming the First Half of Your Essay:
The Values Exercise

Now pick your Top 5.

1. 

Once you have those, pick your Top 3.

And then, yes, pick your #1 value. Remember that you’re not losing any of the others, you’re just picking the most
important value for you today.

Don’t read ahead ‘til you’ve done that.

Really.

Finally, if you know what career you’d like to pursue--Engineering, for example--put the first letter of that career
(E) beside five values of a great Engineer. Maybe you write an “E” next to collaboration, autonomy, and helping
others, and in the blank you write in “working with my hands.”

Once that’s done, set these aside.

I’ll tell you what to do with them in a little bit.
