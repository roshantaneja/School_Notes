To create a more inclusive environment, I leveraged my public speaking skills to bring together diverse student communities. As a class officer, I organized multi-grade events that went beyond the typical pep rallies and football games. Events like the relay race, handless pie-eating contest, and Christmas tree decorating contest fostered a sense of community and encouraged interactions among students from different grades. My ability to engage and inspire my peers through public speaking was crucial in promoting these events and ensuring their success.

  

Recognizing the power of humor and public speaking, I co-founded the Improv Club with two friends. We revived the club by recruiting over 20 students from various grades and bringing in guest coaches to help improve our skills. We organized four school-wide shows, with more planned for the future. These events helped students become less shy and more confident in speaking publicly, creating a community centered around humor and creativity.

  

In the literary community, my public speaking skills were instrumental in introducing Isabel Wilkerson as a guest speaker. I facilitated impactful discussions on social justice and resilience, uplifting minority voices and bringing awareness to important societal issues. Similarly, in the robotics and CS club, I mentored underclassmen in industrial design, 3D printing, milling, and laser cutting. I delivered informational talks, organized workshops, and fostered interest in emerging technologies and STEM fields among my peers, using my public speaking abilities to communicate complex ideas effectively.

  

To celebrate cultural diversity, I introduced Diwali as a festival to my student body, enriching the schoolâ€™s cultural fabric. Additionally, I organized a panel and Q&A session about the Maasai community with Mbayani, further promoting awareness and understanding of different cultures. My public speaking skills were key in engaging students and encouraging them to participate in these cultural events.

  

Through these efforts, I helped create a more inclusive and supportive environment at my school. By using my public speaking skills to address the needs of non-athletic students and fostering a sense of belonging, I ensured that every student could thrive and feel valued.
