Everything in an application is important.
Writing is iterative, not one and done.
If I wanted to just work on my CAPS from now till December, its not possible.
Admissions spend more time evaluating supplements rather than CAPS
Looking for students who are great fits for their school. 
Students who have the academics but also watch with the stuff.
	Looking for students who actually read the supplementals.

List out all of the supplementals, make sure to list out all of the work you need to do to estimate the amount of work required.

Fully read and process each prompt. Youre not answering the questions.

Types of supplemental prompts:
* Why this College
* Intellectual Curiosity/Why this major
* Identity/Diversity
* Extracurricular activities
* Short responses
* Funky Prompts/Choose Your Own Adventure

For example Columbia asks about the books that you have been reading for pleasure. Need to rework your fit based on the prompts asked.

Make sure youre just answering the questions.

Might be able to copy a couple sentences, but never gonna cut it for the whole essay.

Puzzle metaphor. Every part of the puzzle needs to show different parts of you.

Supplement essays might need to discuss activities that are on the list, but cant be repetitive.

Hopefully have relationships with teachers that are writing my reccos.

What is missing in the application that fits within the prompt being asked?

Can take lots of different forms.

Never tell the admission officers what they already know about the college.

Need to think critically about whether a college is actually a good fit for you.

Leveraging SHP alumni and people in your life to know about campus.

## Rule 5:
Project yourself into the role of a current student

when you write an essay that falls into those buckets, need to talke about extracurricular opportunities. that are a fit for your interests.


## Rule 6:
if answering a why major prompt, dont be afraid to nerd out. 

## Rule 7
avoid cliches

chliches can show a lack of introspection and maturity. Lack of understanding of a school.

No statements with the word "Dream" or "Journey" or passion

## Rule 8
Not about what the campus brings to you, its what you can bring to the campus.

---

Whether those essays can get you into the school.

Because of affirmitve action, diversity and identity questions are pretty important to self disclose race and identity to colleges.
