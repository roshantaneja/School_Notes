*Lesson 4.3: What is it about burning fuel that makes a car or rocket move?*
  

### LOOKING BACK

1.  A student claims that the products of a methane bubbles demonstration are both gasses. Do you agree with this claim? 
	Yes, both products are gasses, Carbon Dioxide and Water.

3.  Give the EVIDENCE and REASONING  to support your answer to question 1?  
	Methane is CH4 and Oxygen is O2, therefore the only two molecule it can produce are CO2 and H2O after the reaction
		CH4 + O2 -> CO2 + H2O


### LOOKING FORWARD

3.  Use writing, drawing or a combination of these to explain the connection(s) between burning and energy?

4.  Use writing, drawing or a combination of these to explain the connections between burning, energy, and movement (both at the particle scale, and on a scale that we can see?) 


Exploration:  What is the effect of temperature on the volume of a gas (at 1 atm)?

Safety: 
-   Wear safety glasses![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/TTq5dATdB4m0Jl060PBcKRmcDgyOLac3eiX6f7W3r0DHIbZouOmZr7Ck51SQcUbkWNRxDk8tjTseOYbwzRWwFjBtv4mlEiFK6xIfieEpvPnH4i4tQYU8TIAV30-TSly2AwiHkwnu4sHNiV3wciYgHvOkWnbHFGQwNJCn3VZYx4O-TZIiEGj-dcqRobre5hJRopY1grdEmA)
-   Be careful handling hot glass. Use tongs or heat mitts. 
-   Be careful with hot water
Materials:  
-   Syringe with black cap
-   Two 600 mL beakers
-   2 Thermometers (Use 0C scale)
-   Ring stand![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/INdxNhBFgh77Xs80ARURgfgge5doa3YrUFuzo31dF2vGA_RY3eMrd_dYZYCB9Txk6yAr8eFPLJM5l_3bw_7h3U2aURgki_AWJdPSjcHJoi9xm6iLtlRWMKY5fVcWOqEdZBo5_ySkIGLYgtx5VlSR14f68TIEiD8zg2kgYBceo3ni2LVGu17veo3yLsh7HiDHk7D0tZ9QSg)
-   Two clamps
-   Hot plate
-   Ice

	1.  Create a 500-mL hot water bath, if not done so by the previous class, by pouring approximately 500 mL of tap water into a 600-mL beaker.  Place on the hot plate and heat to a temperature between 85°C and 95°C.  You may need to adjust the temperature control on the hot plate accordingly. 
	2. Create a 500-mL cold water bath, if not done so by the previous class, by pouring approximately 300 mL of tap water into a 600-mL beaker.  Fill the remaining volume of the beaker with ice. 
	3. Take the black cap off the syringe and pull the plunger so that there is 15mL of air.  Use the image to the right to be sure you understand how to read a syringe.
	4. Place the black cap back on the tip of the syringe making sure no air can escape.
	5. Record the room temperature in °C.  This will be the temperature of the initial air sample in the syringe.
	6. Clamp the syringe and lower so that the air sample and some of the syringe is submerged into the ice water.  See image. (Be sure the clamp is not too tight or it will restrict the movement of the syringe plunger) 
	7. Let the syringe rest here for 3 minutes.  After 3 minutes, record the volume of the syringe and temperature in the water bath in the table below.
	8. Remove the syringe and submerge the syringe in the hot water bath using the clamp.
	9. Let the syringe rest in the hot water bath for 3 minutes and record the volume of the air in the syringe and temperature in the table below.
	10. Repeat steps 6 through 9 recording all your data below.


|                              | Temperature, Celsius | Volume of air in the syringe, mL |

5.  Consider the accuracy of your results.
	1.  How did you get reliable measurements? 
	2. How did you know that the air in your syringe reached the temperature you wanted?
		The thermometer displayed the temperature of the water.
    
6.  Analyzing your results.

	2. What happened to the volume of the air sample when the temperature increased? 
	3. Write one statement that summarizes your results.
	4. Go to the [PHET simulation](https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/states-of-matter-basics/latest/states-of-matter-basics_en.html) and explore a particle view of oxygen gas using the states of matter simulation. 
		1.  How did the particle model represent the oxygen gas?
		2. What happens to the oxygen gas particles in the simulation as the temperature is increased?
		3. What happens to the oxygen gas particles in the simulation as the temperature is decreased? 
		4. Write one statement that summarizes your results from the simulation. 
  

### YOUR TURN...MODEL THE SYRINGE SYSTEM 

7.  Draw a model of what you think is happening with the syringe system to cause the syringe plunger to move when surrounded by hot water.

8.  Model details.  
	1.  How are you representing the observable scale movement in your model?
	2.  How are you representing the particle scale movement in your model?
	3. .  How are you representing the movement of particles in your model? 
	4. .  How are you representing temperature in your model?
	5. .  How are you representing energy/changes in your model?
	6. Is there anything missing from your model?
    

  

9.  Below are definitions of energy terms that are common in science and used in chemistry.
	1. Energy: energy is defined as the capacity to do work.  It may exist in potential, kinetic, thermal, chemical, nuclear, or other forms.
	2. Kinetic energy: energy related to an object or particle’s motion, e.g. the movement of the syringe plunger, the movement of a car or rocket, or the movement (or vibrations) of particles. All else being equal, an increase in temperature of matter leads to an increase in the kinetic energy of the particles that make up that matter.
	3. Temperature: a measure of the average kinetic energy of the microscopic particles that comprise matter.
	4. Thermal energy: the total (sum of) energy associated with movement of microscopic particles that make up matter.
	5. Work: when energy is used to move an object from one place to another, e.g. when the movement of the air particles in the syringe pushes the syringe plunger out.
	6. Mechanical energy: a name for energy associated with a machine, including the kinetic energy of the machine itself or of components of a machine (like the plunger of the syringe.
    

  

10.  Consider our model of the syringe.
	1.  Where is the highest kinetic energy in our model?
	2. Where is the highest thermal energy?
	3. What is the evidence that there is mechanical energy?
	4. What is the evidence that work was done?
    

  

11.  Add energy and label the types of energy (kinetic, thermal, mechanical) to your model in #6 of the movement of the plunger in the syringe.
    

  

12.  How does a combustion engine move a car? 
	1.  Watch the following animation of a [4 stroke combustion engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-stroke_engine#/media/File:4StrokeEngine_Ortho_3D_Small.gif) \
	2. Using the terms for energy from question 9, which types of energy are involved in a combustion engine? 
	3. In step 1, what is being added into the chamber?  
	4. In which stroke is combustion happening? 
	5. How does the combustion reaction cause the chamber of the engine to expand? 
	6. How does the combustion observed in this animation relate to the syringe experiment?  

13.  Read this definition of the law of conservation of energy from NASA’s Glenn Research Center. 
	Conservation of Energy - Within some problem domain, the amount of energy remains constant and energy is neither created nor destroyed. Energy can be converted from one form to another (potential energy can be converted to kinetic energy) but the total energy within the domain remains fixed.
	Record your ideas about the following statements below:
	1.   If energy cannot be created or destroyed, just converted/transformed, where is the energy coming from to move the plunger of the syringe? 
	2. Complete the following statement about the conversion of energy:  _________________________energy is being converted to ___________________ energy in order to move the plunger of the syringe. 
    

  

### NEXT STEPS:

1.  Reflect on today’s question: What is it about burning fuel that makes a car or rocket move?
2.  Open up the IMT for this unit, complete all boxes for lesson 3
3.  Make sure all parts of the L4.3 student sheet are complete & complete the check for understanding on schoology.
