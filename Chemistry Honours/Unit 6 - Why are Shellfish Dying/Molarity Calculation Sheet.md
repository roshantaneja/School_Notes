2) 1.2 moles of calcium carbonate in 1.22 liters of solution.



3) 120. grams of calcium nitrite in 240. mL of solution.



4) 98 grams of sodium hydroxide in 2.2 liters of solution.



5) How many grams of potassium carbonate are needed to make 200. mL of a 2.5 M solution?



6) How many liters of 4.0 M solution can be made using 100. grams of lithium bromide?



7) What is the concentration of a 450. mL solution that contains 200. grams of iron (II) chloride?



8) What is the concentration of a solution that has a volume of 2.5 L and contains 660. grams of calcium phosphate?
