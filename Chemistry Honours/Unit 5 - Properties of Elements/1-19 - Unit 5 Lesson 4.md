## What reactions created the different elements in a cell phone?

### Learning Objectives: 

-   Explore the origin of the elements by modeling nuclear reactions, specifically nuclear fusion. 
-   Identify the differences between alpha decay and beta decay.
-   Describe characteristics and equations of nuclear fission and nuclear fusion.
-   Compare and contrast alpha, beta, and gamma radiation.

### Warm-up: 

-   Attendance 
-   Open Student [IMT Unit 5](https://docs.google.com/document/d/127j--zXw26zFZ2Y4GYNWMNp93Gyq57Ew/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=101610972662753304413&rtpof=true&sd=true), make sure all lessons are complete.   

### IN-CLASS WORK:

-   Open [](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BiI9AW6A9Iut7UqEUvftcLAar7xz2VbX8JL4QdRXePs/edit?usp=sharing)[L5.4 Student Sheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TZFFKdMOXuyJvhaYvbEX6PL3y3c8HbyuxZs9IHejjt4/edit?usp=sharing) , make a copy and add to your google drive
-   Last part of class work on practice problems
-   End class with review - what was learned today?

### OUT-OF-CLASS WORK:

-   Open IMT for Unit 5 and make sure all sections for lesson 4 are complete. 
-   Make sure student sheet L5.4 is complete and complete Edpuzzle on schoology.

Part 2:  Nuclear Quest and Types of Radiation
Go over answers from Nuclear Quest Game
Using the Types of Radiation video and help from your teacher, complete the table below.


| Type of radiation/particle | Particle or Energy? | Greek Symbol | Isotopic Symbol | What stops it?    |
| -------------------------- | ------------------- |:------------:| --------------- | ----------------- |
| Alpha                      | Particle            |  $$\alpha$$  | He              | Paper, clothes    |
| Beta                       | Particle            |  $$\beta$$   | e               | Aluminum, plastic |
| Gamma                      | Energy              |  $$\gamma$$  | NA              | Lead, Concrete    |
| Neutron                    | Particle            |      NA      | NA              | Lead, Concrete    |


Part 3 - Equations showing each reaction:  
Nuclear Fusion: Use the image to the right to fill out the  blank ‘--’ spaces below
 1-H + 1-H → 2-He + Ɣ  energy
2-He + 2-He  →11H + 11H + 2-He  + Ɣ (energy)


Nuclear Fission: Use the equation below to complete blank spaces in the image to the right
92235U +01n →92236U →56144Ba +3689Kr + 301n + Ɣ












PRACTICE PROBLEMS:















NEXT STEPS:
Reflect on today’s question: What reactions created the different elements in a cell phone? 
Open up the IMT for this unit, complete all boxes for lesson 4
Make sure all parts of the L5.4 student sheet are complete and complete the check for understanding on Schoology. See agenda on schoology for review resources!
