## What reactions created the different elements in a cell phone?

### Learning Objectives: 

-   Explore the origin of the elements by modeling nuclear reactions, specifically nuclear fusion. 
-   Identify the differences between alpha decay and beta decay.
-   Describe characteristics and equations of nuclear fission and nuclear fusion.
-   Compare and contrast alpha, beta, and gamma radiation.

### Warm-up: 

-   Attendance 
-   Open Student [IMT Unit 5](https://docs.google.com/document/d/127j--zXw26zFZ2Y4GYNWMNp93Gyq57Ew/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=101610972662753304413&rtpof=true&sd=true), make sure all lessons are complete.   

### IN-CLASS WORK:

-   Open [](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BiI9AW6A9Iut7UqEUvftcLAar7xz2VbX8JL4QdRXePs/edit?usp=sharing)[L5.4 Student Sheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TZFFKdMOXuyJvhaYvbEX6PL3y3c8HbyuxZs9IHejjt4/edit?usp=sharing) , make a copy and add to your google drive
-   Last part of class work on practice problems
-   End class with review - what was learned today?

### OUT-OF-CLASS WORK:

-   Open IMT for Unit 5 and make sure all sections for lesson 4 are complete. 
-   Make sure student sheet L5.4 is complete and complete Edpuzzle on schoology.
