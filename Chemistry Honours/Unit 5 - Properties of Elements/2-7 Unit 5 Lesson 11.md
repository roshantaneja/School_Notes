Part 4: Write a revised CER - 

1.  Complete the Unit 4 IMT, making sure that you have the information you need for this to be a study guide for the assessment next class.
    
2.  Using the information that we learned in this unit and your updated IMT for Unit 4, write a revised CER in paragraph form that answers the unit question: At the end of your smartphone life, will you recycle, reuse, or dispose of your smartphone? Be sure to include chemistry.  Use the [CER graphic organizer](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rS295CuTXqsjginfLqW2iJtAN5e43xD-K_qsmeb-opQ/edit?usp=sharing) if helpful.
