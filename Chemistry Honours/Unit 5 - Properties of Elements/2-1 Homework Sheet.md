| **Cycle Step**                                                             | **Chemical Name**     | **Chemical Formula** | **Element or Compound?** | **Mass** | **Molar Mass** | **Calculated Moles** | **Calculated Number of Particles** |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------ | -------- | -------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Initially, you measured 0.10 g of copper powder.                           | copper                | Cu                   | Cu2                      | 0.10g    |                |                      |                                    |
| **_Show work for calculations for moles and number of particles_**:        |                       |                      |                          |          |                |                      |                                    |
| In **step 2**, 0.25 g of copper (II) hydroxide was made.                   | copper (II) hydroxide | Cu(OH)2              |                          | 0.25g    |                |                      |                                    |
| **_Show work for calculations for moles and number of particles_**:        |                       |                      |                          |          |                |                      |                                    |
| In **step 3**, 0.20 g of a black powder called copper (II) oxide was made. | copper (II) oxide     | CuO                  |                          | 0.20g    |                |                      |                                    |
| **_Show work for calculations for moles and number of particles_**:        |                       |                      |                          |          |                |                      |                                    |
| In **step 5**, you added 0.10 g Zn filings.                                | zinc                  | Zn                   |                          | 0.10g    |                |                      |                                    |
