| -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------ | -------- | -------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Initially, you measured 0.10 g of copper powder.                           | copper                | Cu                   | Element                  | 0.10g    |                |                      |                                    |
| Show work for calculations for moles and number of particles:              |                       |                      |                          |          |                |                      |                                    |
| In **step 2**, 0.25 g of copper (II) hydroxide was made.                   | copper (II) hydroxide | Cu(OH)2              | Compound                 | 0.25g    |                |                      |                                    |
