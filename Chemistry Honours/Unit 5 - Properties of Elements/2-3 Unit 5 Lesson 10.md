**Step 1:**  “Colorless nitric acid is added to solid orange-brown copper powder, resulting in a blue-green solution, a brown gas, and liquid water.”

HNO is added to Cu, resulting in Cu(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(aq) and NO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O.

The copper atoms are in Cu(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(aq)/Copper(II) Nitrate. The copper is in compound form.

**Step 2:**  “Clear, colorless sodium hydroxide solution is added to the blue-green solution, resulting in clumps of dark blue solid and clear, colorless sodium nitrate solution.”  

NaOH(aq) is added to Cu(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(aq), resulting in Cu(OH)<sub>2</sub>(s) and Na(NO<sub>3</sub>).

The copper atoms are in Cu(OH)<sub>2</sub>(s)/Copper(II) Hydroxide.  The copper is in compound form.

---

**Step 3:**  “The dark blue clumps are heated, resulting in a black solid and liquid water.”

Cu(OH)<sub>2</sub>(s) is heated, resulting in CuO(s) and H<sub>2</sub>O.

The copper atoms are in  CuO(s)/Copper(II) Oxide.  The copper is in compound form.

**Step 4:**  “Clear, colorless sulfuric acid is added to the black solid, resulting in a clear blue solution and liquid water.”

H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>(aq) is added to CuO(s), resulting in CuSO<sub>4</sub>(aq)and H<sub>2</sub>O.

The copper atoms are in  CuSO<sub>4</sub>(aq)/ Copper(II) Sulfate.  The copper is in ( elemental  or compound )

---

**Step 5:**  “Solid, silver-gray zinc is added to the clear blue solution, resulting in a brownish powder and clear, colorless zinc sulfate solution.”

Zn(s) is added to CuSO<sub>4</sub>(aq), resulting in ZnSO<sub>4</sub> and Cu(s).

The copper atoms are in  Cu(s)/Copper.  The copper is in elemental form.
