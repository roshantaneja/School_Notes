**Laboratory: How can we extract and purify copper? **

The copper in our smartphone that we saw when we disassembled our phones as sheets in the battery or wires in the speaker or connections in our electronics is found in the Earth. Copper is found in the Earth as rocks or ores. Copper has to be ‘mined’ and refined in order to be used as components of electronics. There are two distinct types of copper deposits: sulfide ore and oxide ore. In this experiment, we are going to start with a sample of copper in its elemental form, Cu(s), and observe the many ionic compounds that exist with copper ions, finally recovering the elemental copper again. This experiment mirrors the process of finding ore and the reactions that must take place to mine and isolate the elemental copper for use in electronics and other products.

**SAFETY AND PREPARATION:**

Before proceeding with the experiment, read over the [Laboratory Procedure](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AZ0NaKyWZ3Pu02FMjgwUbrGOWFkhWFCn/view?usp=sharing) and answer the following safety questions:



1. When do I wear my safety goggles?

   All the time

2. What are the three chemicals I need to handle with special care?
   
   Basically everything except the sulfur and copper, but be generally careful with everything
   
3. Is nitrogen dioxide a harmful gas? 
   
   Yes, so dont breathe it in?
   
4. Where do I do the step in the procedure that involves the production of nitrogen dioxide?
   
   You wont, Mr Grieb will do it
   
5. What precautions should I take when I heat chemicals?
   
   Dont touch anything with your bare hands, dont inhale fumes, dont take off your goggles
   
6. Does hot glassware look the same as cold glassware?
   
   Yes, and its dangerous
   
7. Who should I ask if I have questions during the lab?
   
   
   

**OBSERVATIONS: **Throughout the experiment, record observations at the corresponding steps in the procedure.

| What you did                                                                  | What you observed | 
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Step 1: Started with copper, Cu (s).                                          |                   |
| Step 2: Added nitric acid, HNO3 (aq).                                         |                   |
| Step 4: Added water, H2O (l).                                                 |                   |
| Step 5: Added sodium hydroxide, NaOH (aq).                                    |                   |
| Step 6: Heated the mixture.                                                   |                   |
| Step 8: Filtered the solid and added sulfuric acid, H2SO4 (aq), to the solid. |                   |
| Step 10: Added sulfuric acid, H2SO4 (aq), to the solid.                       |                   |
| Step 11: Added zinc, Zn (s).                                                  |                   |
| Step 13: Poured off liquid and rinsed.                                        |                   |
