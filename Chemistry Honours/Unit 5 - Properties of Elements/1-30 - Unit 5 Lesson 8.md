Part 4.  Avogadro’s Number Revisited

Although manufacturers base production on the cost of the elements in the smartphone, engineers need to know how many atoms of the elements are present in the smartphone to do the work. The atoms send the charge or light the display or protect the electronics. The question of 'How many atoms?', is a count.  We need to count the atoms, but they are too small to count, so we use mass. Scientists mass the elements and from this mass, determine how many atoms are present in a smartphone by using an equivalence statement.   

Because atoms are small, we need to have a big number to represent the number of atoms that would be visible to the human eye and able to be massed on our balances.  The number we use is called Avogadro's number.  Avogadro's Number is 6.02 x 1023  Avogadro's number is a big number because atoms are so, so small.

<center>Avogadro's Number, N = 6.02 X 1023</center>

We have words that represent numbers in our language.  For example, a dozen means a count of 12 and a ream means a count of 500.  A sample with 6.02 x 1023 particles is called a mole. 

In this activity, there are samples around the room with 6.02 x 1023 atoms or 6.02 x 1023 particles.  Each sample is a 1 mole sample. Your challenge is to figure out how the samples were created?  How do we, your teachers or any scientist, know the mass of a sample containing 6.02 x 1023 particles? We promise that we did not count the individual atoms because this would take 3,000,000 years if counting one atom per second to reach 6.02 x 1023 atoms (or to count anything).  

To help you figure out how the samples are made, travel the room, record the mass, look at the data, and consider how the masses were derived.  Good luck - and once you figure it out, create a sample of 6.02 x 1023 Iron atoms of your own.  Your instructor will know if you understand if you can create your own sample!

| Sample   | Chemical Formula | Atom Count   | Number of Moles | Mass (g) |
| -------- | ---------------- | ------------ | --------------- | -------- |
| Copper   | Cu               | 6.02 x 10^23 | 1 mol           |          | 
| Zinc     | Zn               | 6.02 x 10^23 | 1 mol           |          |
| Aluminum | Al               | 6.02 x 10^23 | 1 mol           |          |

In your own words, describe how these samples of 6.02 x 1023 atoms of each element were made.

| Your turn. Make a sample of 6.02 x 1023 atoms of iron using nails. Record the chemical formula and mass. |     |             |       |     |     |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --- | ----------- | ----- | --- | --- |
| Iron                                                                                                     | Fe  | 6.02 x 1023 | 1 mol |     |     |

Part 5. Molar Mass, Moles and Atoms-How many moles are in your smartphone samples?  How many atoms are in your smartphone samples? 

Molar Mass:  The molar mass is the mass of one mole of a substance.  The substance can be an element or a compound.  The average atomic mass on the periodic table is the molar mass of that element.  

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pumf0wbIpxYP2W1BfN-tETiAddQXlprj4Roc2MuIRzp29832j-ZtlfFjoN15xFo9irJH-Z-DPUZyq8iKapVGEM_kgFRKOsuJ2iinTiH3mO4ORCeE_oHtj11Gxw-W9a4a8bAW7jlhstmqeJKAlEnGtgc)

The average atomic mass of a compound is calculated by adding the average atomic mass of each element taking into account how many of the elements are in the formula. ![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/vf4DQiWkf4s6HwBRruYlUPH-z1RQekEvibWB8o6483WlbrZGRzMWmAAvjkz15XGwlhUtgXoG-lb2uODOl2_y3NO1ELxsNK4mpfuBp1ELrhP9IDs0hB21-qgZme1sUzm1s5exhbK84JDMjlVknB2Pwac)

  

  

  

  

Molar Mass Calculations: Using the molar mass, the number of moles from a mass, and the number of particles from moles can be calculated.![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Sd8wJx579YmYGlrJU78WjsMPZKYqw8kuVIfmiSRb9fCySYFeMz7vXj8BJreveFP7UUzxNUuUXMwRbeXShjQY9qWJ0Jyiw7ugsuv0grKyQ4eB2DnEiZPJgOynioQwr72jcSgFioGhT4Jc9-MaXMQz0FQ)
