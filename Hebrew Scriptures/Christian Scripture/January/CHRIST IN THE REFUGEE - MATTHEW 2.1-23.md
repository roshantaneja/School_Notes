CHRIST IN THE REFUGEE: MATTHEW 2:1-23
Read James Martin’s article: [“Were Jesus, Mary, and Joseph refugees? Yes.”](https://www.americamagazine.org/faith/2017/12/27/were-jesus-mary-and-joseph-refugees-yes) 

1.  What is the author’s thesis?  
      
      Jesus Mary and Joseph were refugees.
    
2.  Give two quotations and explain how these quotes give evidence to support the author’s thesis.  
      
      "A family is forced to flee their homeland for fear of persecution. This is the classic modern-day definition of a refugee."
      
    
3.  Personal Reflection: What is challenging/enlightening/thought-provoking about the article for you? Explain. (No right answer here, as long as you show you are thoughtfully considering the implications of the article and giving sound reasoning for your opinions)  
      
      The angel literally tells joseph to "flee" to egypt, almost literally calling them refugees. 
    

Listen to [Carlos’ Story:](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RtRQL8ObRQTVd5nBMRBB2m1mcQ6cx9NO/view?usp=sharing) This father and son pair came to the Kino Border Initiative in Nogales, MX which is a Catholic non-profit seeking to provide accompaniment and advocacy for migrants. 

4.  What from the story stands out to you and why?  
      
      
      
    
5.  Reflecting on Scripture through the lens of the migrant: How does this family’s story humanize and illuminate the experience of the Holy Family fleeing to Egypt in Matthew’s Gospel? In other words, what does it make you consider or wonder about what Mary, Joseph, and Jesus’ experienced?  
      
      
      
    
6.  Reflecting on the experience of migrants through the lens of the Gospel: How might the Gospel story and the claim that Christ is in the refugee be good news to migrants like the father and son from El Salvador? What difference could it make for them to claim that truth?  
      
      
      
      
    
7.  If the “Flight to Egypt” shows that God/Christ is present in the migrant/refugee, what might these stories (the Gospel story and the Salvadoran family’s story) call forth from people who call themselves Christian? What would it look like to “live as though this truth were true” and what are the challenges of living that out? (This could be purely academic reasoning if you are not Christian, or you could make it personal if you are Christian).**
