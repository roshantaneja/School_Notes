If we assume that all of the energy from the reaction goes into the water, then the energy released from the reaction is approximately equal to the energy absorbed by the water. This is due to the law of conservation of energy. We will record the mass of the water and the temperature before and after the reaction to determine the total energy absorbed. This method of determining the amount of energy released from a reaction is known as calorimetry. It\u2019s also the same process that food scientists use to determine the amount of energy in calories in the foods you eat.\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p>When we know the mass, specific heat (how well something holds heat), and change of temperature of the system or the surroundings, then we can calculate the energy transferred using the equation:\u00a0</p> <p>q = mcs\u0394T\u00a0\u00a0  </p> <p>q = heat in joules</p> <p>m = mass in g</p> <p>cs = the specific heat capacity</p> <p>\u0394T = the change in temperature in oC  </p> <p>Because the object and surroundings are in contact, the energy transferred between the object and surroundings is equal and is measured using the equation \u2013q = +q.  </p> <p>The \u2013q represents the releasing energy, which indicates an exothermic process (Look at the picture below).\u00a0 An exothermic process is where an object loses energy to the surroundings and the surroundings gain the same amount of energy according to the law of conservation of energy.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p>The +q represents gaining energy, which indicates an endothermic process (Look at the picture object gains the same amount of energy according to the law of conservation of energy.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p>The amount of energy transferred from an object to the surrounding or from the surrounding to an object is equal in magnitude due to the law of conservation of energy, but not in sign.\u00a0</p> <p>Practice Problems for q = mcs\u0394T</p> <ol> <li> <p>How much energy is needed to change the temperature of 50.0 g of H2O by 150C?\u00a0</p> </li> <li> <p>How many grams of water can be heated from 20.0oC to 75.0oC using 12500.0 Joules?</p> </li> <li> <p>What is the final temperature after 840 Joules is absorbed by 10.0g of water at 25.0oC?</p> </li> <li> <p>What is the specific heat of aluminium if the temperature of a 28.4 g sample of aluminum in increased by 8.10C, when 207J of heat is added?\u00a0</p> </li> <li> <p>What is the specific heat of silicon if the temperature of a 4.11 g sample of silicon is increased by 3.80C when 11.1 J of heat is added?\u00a0</p> </li> <li> <p>How much heat must be added to an 8.21g sample of gold to increase it\u2019s temperature by 6.20C?

As the number of protons in the nucleus changes, so does the atomic number. Elements are arranged on the periodic table in order of increasing atomic number.</p> <ol> <li>If two elements are next to each other such as Hydrogen and Helium, how do their atomic numbers compare?\u00a0 What does that tell you about the number of protons?\u00a0</li> </ol> <p>The atomic number of Hydrogen is 1 and the atomic number of Helium is 2. This tells us that Helium has one more proton in its nucleus than Hydrogen.</p> <ol> <li>How could you change Silicon (14) to Phosphorus (15)?\u00a0</li> </ol> <p>Silicon can be changed to Phosphorus by either adding or removing a proton from the nucleus. This can be achieved through a process called nuclear transmutation, which involves bombarding the nucleus of an atom with a high-energy particle, such as a neutron, proton, or alpha particle.</p> <ol> <li>Do you think that in a high school chemistry class we could change silicon to phosphorus?\u00a0 Why or why not?</li> </ol> <p>It is unlikely that a high school chemistry class would have the equipment or resources to change silicon to phosphorus through nuclear transmutation.

The atoms send the charge or light the display or protect the electronics. The question of 'How many atoms?', is a count.\u00a0 We need to count the atoms, but they are too small to count, so we use mass. Scientists mass the elements and from this mass, determine how many atoms are present in a smartphone by using an equivalence statement.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p>Because atoms are small, we need to have a big number to represent the number of atoms that would be visible to the human eye and able to be massed on our balances.\u00a0 The number we use is called Avogadro's number.\u00a0 Avogadro's Number is 6.02 x 1023\u00a0 Avogadro's number is a big number because atoms are so, so small.</p> <p>Avogadro's Number, N = 6.02 X 1023</p> <p>We have words that represent numbers in our language.\u00a0 For example, a dozen means a count of 12 and a ream means a count of 500. \u00a0A sample with 6.02 x 1023 particles is called a mole.\u00a0</p> <p>In this activity, there are samples around the room with 6.02 x 1023 atoms or 6.02 x 1023 particles.\u00a0 Each sample is a 1 mole sample. Your challenge is to figure out how the samples were created?\u00a0 How do we, your teachers or any scientist, know the mass of a sample containing 6.02 x 1023 particles? We promise that we did not count the individual atoms because this would take 3,000,000 years if counting one atom per second to reach 6.02 x 1023 atoms (or to count anything).\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p>To help you figure out how the samples are made, travel the room, record the mass, look at the data, and consider how the masses were derived.\u00a0 Good luck - and once you figure it out, create a sample of 6.02 x 1023 Iron atoms of your own.\u00a0 Your instructor will know if you understand if you can create your own sample!</p> Sample Chemical Formula Atom Count Number of Moles Mass (g) Copper Cu 6.02 x 10^23 1 mol 61.7 Zinc Zn 6.02 x 10^23 1 mol 64.82 Aluminum Al 6.02 x 10^23 1 mol 29.93 <p>In your own words, describe how these samples of 6.02 x 1023 atoms of each element were made.</p> Your turn.

Copper is found in the Earth as rocks or ores. Copper has to be \u2018mined\u2019 and refined in order to be used as components of electronics. There are two distinct types of copper deposits: sulfide ore and oxide ore. In this experiment, we are going to start with a sample of copper in its elemental form, Cu(s), and observe the many ionic compounds that exist with copper ions, finally recovering the elemental copper again. This experiment mirrors the process of finding ore and the reactions that must take place to mine and isolate the elemental copper for use in electronics and other products.</p> <p>SAFETY AND PREPARATION:</p> <p>Before proceeding with the experiment, read over the Laboratory Procedure and answer the following safety questions:</p> <ol> <li>When do I wear my safety goggles?</li> </ol> <p>All the time</p> <ol> <li>What are the three chemicals I need to handle with special care?</li> </ol> <p>Basically everything except the sulfur and copper, but be generally careful with everything</p> <ol> <li>Is nitrogen dioxide a harmful gas? </li> </ol> <p>Yes, so dont breathe it in?</p> <ol> <li>Where do I do the step in the procedure that involves the production of nitrogen dioxide?</li> </ol> <p>in the fume hood</p> <ol> <li>What precautions should I take when I heat chemicals?</li> </ol> <p>Dont touch anything with your bare hands, dont inhale fumes, dont take off your goggles</p> <ol> <li>Does hot glassware look the same as cold glassware?</li> </ol> <p>Yes, and its dangerous</p> <ol> <li>Who should I ask if I have questions during the lab?</li> </ol> <p>Mr Grieb.</p> <p>*OBSERVATIONS: *Throughout the experiment, record observations at the corresponding steps in the procedure.</p> What you did What you observed Step 1:Started with copper, Cu (s).

Its translucent blue, lower concentration of copper cuz we added a bunch of stuff Step 6:Heated the mixture. Turned brown and then black, and bubbles appeared. Step 8:Filtered the solid and added sulfuric acid, H2SO4 (aq), to the solid. Step 10:Added sulfuric acid, H2SO4 (aq), to the solid. Step 11:Added zinc, Zn (s).

This includes all forms of water; solid, liquid, and gas, on Earth. Earth\u2019s hydrosphere cycles the finite amount of water on Earth. Oceans cover nearly three-quarters of Earth\u2019s surface and hold 97 percent of the total water volume on Earth. (Doyle, et al., 2015) Freshwater, both solid and liquid, make up the last 3 percent. Solid water, or ice, has its own designation within the hydrosphere called the cryosphere. Scientists have learned a lot about Earth\u2019s history, atmospheric composition, and temperatures from studying the cryosphere.\u00a0</p> <p>There are two types of ice in the cryosphere: land ice and sea ice. Land ice is freshwater ice and includes glaciers, icebergs, and sheet ice because each originates on land.\u00a0 Sheet ice, is located around Earth, but 99% of it is located in the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets. (National Snow and Ice Data Center [NSICD], 2020) An ice sheet forms on land when the annual snowfall exceeds the annual snowmelt. (NSIDC, 2019) Ice sheets take thousands of years to form and can be thousands of feet thick and tens to thousands of miles across. (NSIDC, 2019) Ice sheets are able to flow, or move, and move out in all directions. Ice sheets are continental glaciers. Sea ice is frozen seawater floating on its surface. Sea ice forms from ocean water. Sea ice contains very little salt. Sea ice forms seasonally and can cover millions of square kilometers each polar season. (NSIDC, 2019) While sea ice is found in both the Arctic and Antarctic, some of the ice lasts year after year in the Arctic, while in the Antarctic the majority melts and reforms each season.</p> Land ice in Greenland Sea Ice: Arctic (top) &amp; Antarctica (bottom) <ol> <li> <p>Answer the following questions from the reading.</p> </li> <li> <p>What is the hydrosphere?</p> </li> <li> <p>What are the states H2O occurs on Earth?</p> </li> <li> <p>What percentage of the Earth is covered by ocean water?</p> </li> <li> <p>What percentage of the total volume of water on Earth is held in the ocean?</p> </li> <li> <p>What percentage of water as solid and liquid is freshwater?</p> </li> <li> <p>What is the cryosphere?</p> </li> <li> <p>What two locations contain the majority of the land ice or sheet ice?</p> </li> <li> <p>Is sheet ice fresh or saltwater?</p> </li> <li> <p>How is sea ice different than land ice?</p> </li> </ol> <p>Continue onto Part 3, if your ice is not melted in Part 1.</p> <p>Part 3: Investigation: What happens when liquid water is heated?\u00a0</p> <ol> <li> </li> </ol> <p>MATERIAL</p> <ul> <li> <p>600-mL Beaker</p> </li> <li> <p>125-mL Erylenmeyer Flask (some classes may have 250-mL Erylenmeyer Flask)</p> </li> <li> <p>One hole rubber stopper with 10 mL glass pipette</p> </li> <li> <p>Hot plate\u00a0</p> </li> <li> <p>Thermometer</p> </li> </ul> <p>PROCEDURE:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Look at the 10-mL pipette and notice the scale.\u00a0 Readings will be taken to the hundredth spot.\u00a0 Use the scale that is from 0 \u2192 10 in the fine print.

Moving from the top of the diagram back down, you go from a gas to a solid (condensation and then freezing)</p> <p>The concept of the heating curve is very important as it helps us in figuring out what equation to use to quantify the heat associated with phase changes and temperature changes. We should note that two of the three things that could happen when you add heat to a substance is that either it will undergo a phase change, or its temperature will rise. These are the two effects being described by the heating/cooling curve. The mathematical equations are:</p> <p>q=mc \u0394T (energy of a temperature change within a phase) q=\u0394Hm transition (energy of a phase transition)</p> <p>It needs to be realized that if you add heat, you move to the right, and if you remove heat, you move to the left.</p> <p>Let's use these two equations to quantify how much energy is needed for water to change temperatures.</p> <ol> <li>You have a sample of water which has a mass of 55.0g.

Eventually, thermodynamic equilibrium will be reached. The temperatures have then completely equalized and a common final temperature has been established, which is also referred to as the mixing temperature.</p> <p>One can observe such an equalization of temperatures, for example, when pouring hot water into a cold glass. While the glass is heated by the hot water, the water cools down on the relatively cold glass. After some time, the different initial temperatures have equalized and the glass has the same temperature as the water inside it. The final temperature lies between these two initial temperatures.</p> <p>Depending on how much water is poured into the glass, the final temperature is shifted towards higher or lower values. With a larger amount of water, it can be assumed that higher final temperatures result, since more hot water is present and causes greater heating of the glass. The equalization of temperatures can be explained using the particle model. This is discussed in detail in the article Heat and thermodynamic equilibrium.</p> <p>If the energy flow is equal to q = mc\u2206T, and when two substances are being mixed the amount of temperature absorbed equals the amount of energy released given the equation +q = -q.\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p>Remember that \u2206T = Tf - Ti.\u00a0 To derive the equation for Tf we need the initial equation, m1c1(Tf - T1i) = -[m2c2(Tf - T2i)], where the subscript 1 represents the colder substance and the subscript 2 represents the warmer substance.</p> <p>Simplified,\u00a0 m1c1Tf \u00a0- m1c1T1i \u00a0= -m2c2Tf + m2c2T2i</p> <p>Tf = m1\u22c5c1\u22c5T1i+ m2\u22c5c2\u22c5T2im1\u22c5c1+m2\u22c5c2</p> <p>17.\u00a0 Use this derived equation to predict the final temperature of water for the following problems.\u00a0 Remember the density of liquid water is 1g/mL and the specific heat of water is 4.18 J/goC.</p> <ol> <li> <p>150.0 mL of 25.0oC water mixed with 75.0 mL of 50.0oC water.

Colligative Properties depend on how many solute particles are present as well as the solvent amount, but they do NOT depend on the type of solute particles, although do depend on the type of solvent. \u00a0 The colligative property that you witnessed is called freezing point depression, where the freezing point is lowered due to dissolved solute in solution.\u00a0 There are other colligative properties, but for our intents and purposes, we will analyze freezing point depression.\u00a0</p> <p>Let's start this discussion the same way we started the others, by defining the normal freezing point. The normal freezing point of a liquid is the temperature at which a liquid becomes a solid at 1 atm. A more specific definition of a freezing point is the temperature at which solid and liquid phases coexist in equilibrium. For water, the freezing point is 0oC.\u00a0 Let's see if we can figure out why the freezing point is lowered when we add solutes to a solution. We already know that in order to freeze a liquid, we have to lower the temperature. As the temperature lowers, the solution becomes more ordered as it moves toward the solid phase. This is an effect that works against the second law of thermodynamics. In short, entropy (disorder) likes to increase not decrease in the natural scheme of things. So if we have to lower the temperature to a certain point to freeze a pure solvent, when we add a solute we add to the entropy of the system, right? The mixture is more disordered than the pure. This additional amount of entropy must now be overcome to allow the liquid to change phases into a solid (become ordered). This means that the temperature will have to be even lower than before. Thus the addition of any type of solute to a solvent will lower its freezing point.</p> <p>The equation to figure out how great the change in temperature will be is given by:</p> <p>\u0394T = iKfm</p> <p>\u0394T= change in temperature</p> <p>i = the van't Hoff factor, which is the number of particles into which the solute dissociates</p> <p>m = the molality, which is the moles of solute per kilograms (mols/kg) of solvent</p> <p>Kf = the molal freezing point constant (for water, Kf = -1.86 oC/m)</p> <p>So the change in temperature is dependent on the number of particles (i) in one mole of solute dissolved in the amount of solvent (m).\u00a0</p> <p>Let\u2019s do some practice\u2026</p> <ol> <li>What is the freezing point of a solution of 15.0 g of NaCl in 250 g of water?

The more collisions of gas molecules with the walls, the higher the pressure.\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p>Temperature, T: The temperature of a gas is a measure of the average translational kinetic energy of the molecules.

The compound represents a chemical compound in the equation, the index keeps track of where we are in the equation, and the side tells us if it's a reactant (-1) or a product (1).  </p> <p>RT: Inside this function, we split the compound into segments using regular expressions. If a segment starts with a parenthesis, it means there's a multiplier attached to it. We extract the segment and its multiplier, and then we pass it to the 'findElements' function.  </p> <p>RT: In the 'findElements' function, we split the segment into elements and their corresponding counts. We iterate through these elements and counts, checking if the count is a number or not. If it is, we calculate the total count by multiplying it with the multiplier from the 'compoundDecipher' function. Finally, we add this element to the 'elementMatrix' using the 'addToMatrix' function.  </p> <p>RT: The 'addToMatrix' function is where the magic happens! We check if the index matches the length of the 'elementMatrix'. If it does, it means we need to add a new row to the matrix. We also add a column for the new element in all the existing rows.  </p> <p>RT: If the element is not already in the 'elementList', we add it and update the corresponding columns in the 'elementMatrix'. Then, we calculate the column index of the element and update the count in the 'elementMatrix' at the specified index and column.  </p> <p>RT: Okay, now that we've deciphered and stored all the elements and their counts, it's time to move on to the next step: balancing the equation! But before we do that, let's print out the 'elementList' and 'elementMatrix' just to see what we've got.  </p> <p>RT: [typing] print(elementList) print(elementMatrix)  </p> <p>[ON-SCREEN: Output: elementList and elementMatrix]  </p> <p>RT: Now, let's talk about the balancing process. We create a matrix using the 'elementMatrix' list and then transpose it. This is where 'sympy' comes in handy! We find the nullspace of the transposed matrix, which gives us the solution vector. We multiply this vector by the least common multiple (LCM) of its denominators to make the coefficients integers.  </p> <p>RT: Finally, we format the coefficients and compounds into a balanced chemical equation. We iterate through the reactants and products, and for each compound, we append the coefficient multiplied by the compound itself to the 'output' string. We make sure to add a plus sign between compounds within the same side of the equation.  </p> <p>RT: [typing] output += str(coEffi[i][0]) + reactants[i] if i &lt; len(reactants) - 1: output += \" + \"  </p> <p>RT: After we've added all the reactants, we insert the arrow symbol to indicate the transition from reactants to products.  </p> <p>RT: [typing] output += \" -&gt; \"  </p> <p>RT: Then, we iterate through the products and append the coefficient multiplied by the product compound to the 'output' string. We also ensure to include a plus sign between multiple products, if applicable.  </p> <p>RT: [typing] output += str(coEffi[i + len(reactants)][0]) + products[i] if i &lt; len(products) - 1: output += \" + \"  </p> <p>RT: Finally, we have our balanced chemical equation stored in the 'output' variable. Let's print it out and see the result!  </p> <p>RT: [typing] print(output)  </p> <p>[ON-SCREEN: Output: Balanced chemical equation]  </p> <p>RT: And there you have it, folks! Our Python script successfully balances the chemical equation. We've gone from deciphering the compounds, calculating the element counts, finding the solution vector, to formatting the coefficients and compounds into a balanced equation.

Today, we have a really important topic to discuss: climate change. It's one of the most pressing issues of our time, and it affects everyone on this planet. So, in this video, we're going to use some Python programming to analyze and visualize climate change data. Sounds exciting, right? Let's jump right in!  </p> <p>[Roshan starts explaining the code] Roshan: Alright, first things first, let's import the necessary libraries. We'll be using Pandas for data wrangling, NumPy for numerical operations, and Matplotlib and Plotly for data visualization. These libraries will help us make sense of the temperature change data we're going to work with.  </p> <p>[Code snippets appear on screen as Roshan explains] Roshan: We'll be using a dataset called FAOSTAT Temperature Change, which provides statistics on mean surface temperature change by country. This dataset covers temperature changes from 1961 to 2019. Our goal is to explore this data and answer some key questions about climate change.  </p> <p>[Roshan continues explaining the code and data preprocessing] Roshan: Now that we have the data, we need to preprocess it a bit. We'll rename some columns, filter out unnecessary columns, and merge the data with ISO-3 country codes for better organization. This will make our analysis and visualization easier later on.  </p> <p>[Roshan moves on to the next section: \"Investigation of Guiding Questions\"] Roshan: Alright, now that we have our data ready, let's dig into some questions about climate change. The first question we want to tackle is: \"What are the ten countries that have suffered from the highest temperature change in the last ten years?\"  </p> <p>[Graph visualization appears on screen] Roshan: Here's a bar chart showing the top ten countries with the highest temperature change. As you can see, countries like Russia, Germany, and France are among the most affected. It's important to note that all of these countries are industrialized, which highlights the impact of human activities on climate change.  </p> <p>[Roshan moves on to the next question] Roshan: Now, let's flip the question around. We want to find out the ten countries that have experienced the least temperature change in the last ten years.  </p> <p>[Another graph visualization appears on screen] Roshan: Here's a bar chart showing the countries with the lowest temperature change. Surprisingly, India, a developing country with significant industrial activities, is among the countries with the least temperature change. This suggests that industrialization alone may not be the sole factor driving temperature change.  </p> <p>Title: Calculation and Analysis of Global Moving Average Temperature Trends  </p> <p>Introduction: Understanding the long-term trends in global temperature is crucial for assessing the impact of climate change. One commonly used metric to analyze these trends is the global moving average temperature. In this section, we will delve into the calculation method of the global moving average temperature and discuss its steady upward trajectory over the past 60 years.  </p> <p>Calculation of Global Moving Average Temperature: To calculate the global moving average temperature, a widely adopted approach involves averaging the annual temperature anomalies over a specific period. Temperature anomalies represent deviations from a reference period's average temperature, usually the pre-industrial era. The moving average smooths out short-term fluctuations and allows us to identify long-term trends more clearly.  </p> <p>Step 1: Data Collection and Preparation: Collecting accurate and reliable temperature data is vital for calculating the global moving average. Climate scientists typically use data from multiple sources, including ground-based weather stations, satellite measurements, and oceanic observations. These datasets are carefully processed and quality-controlled to ensure consistency and accuracy.  </p> <p>Step 2: Calculation of Temperature Anomalies: To calculate temperature anomalies, the average temperature for a reference period is subtracted from the actual annual temperature. This calculation helps remove seasonal variations and provides a clearer picture of long-term temperature trends. The reference period is typically chosen to represent a stable climate before significant anthropogenic influence.  </p> <p>Step 3: Determining the Moving Average Period: The moving average period refers to the number of years over which the average is calculated. Longer periods offer a more comprehensive perspective on climate trends, while shorter periods capture more recent fluctuations. Common choices for the moving average period range from 5 to 10 years or more.  </p> <p>Step 4: Averaging the Temperature Anomalies: By taking the average of temperature anomalies for each year over the selected moving average period, we obtain the global moving average temperature. This value represents the smoothed and trended temperature data, making it easier to discern long-term climate patterns.  </p> <p>Steady Increase in Global Moving Average Temperature: The analysis of the global moving average temperature reveals a consistent upward trend over the past 60 years. By using this approach, scientists have identified the ongoing global warming phenomenon and its potential implications for the Earth's climate system. The upward trajectory indicates that, on average, the Earth's temperature has been increasing steadily, with notable year-to-year variations.  </p> <p>The steady increase in the global moving average temperature provides compelling evidence of climate change and aligns with the findings of numerous scientific studies. It underscores the need for urgent action to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, adapt to the changing climate, and protect vulnerable ecosystems and communities worldwide.  </p> <p>Conclusion: The calculation and analysis of the global moving average temperature offer valuable insights into long-term climate trends. By smoothing out short-term fluctuations, this approach enables us to identify the steady upward trajectory of global temperatures over the past 60 years. Recognizing the significance of these trends is essential for addressing climate change and implementing effective strategies to ensure a sustainable future for our planet.  </p> <p>[Roshan concludes the video] Roshan: And there you have it, hackers! We've explored some key questions about climate change using Python and data analysis. It's important to understand the impact of climate change and take action to mitigate its effects. Remember, we all share this planet, and it's up to us to make a difference.

So as a result of his necessity, he created a program that uses Secure tunneling to access hypertext files from a server and read them remotely. This was the first user-to-website interaction.

In particular, the web's ability to connect people and information across geographic and cultural boundaries has transformed how we access and share information. Tim Berners-Lee's founding of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and his decision to make the web's technology royalty-free were pivotal in shaping the development of the web as an open, accessible platform for innovation and collaboration as well as its lasting impact on American society. This paper will explore the historical context and significance of Berners-Lee's decision and its ongoing implications for the future of the web and the digital economy. By examining how the web has evolved over the years since its birth, this paper will provide insights into the challenges and opportunities as we navigate the digital age's complex and rapidly changing landscape and its impact on humanity.</p> <p>The internet started in the late 1960s as a method for government researchers to share information. Computers in the 60s were large and clunky and a nuisance. Before the internet, information could only be shared if one traveled to the computer's location or was documented on a magnetic tape and shipped through the postal system. Another catalyst for the creation of the internet was the heated tensions during the cold war. The US Defense Dept. wanted to ensure a method of information dissemination even after a nuclear fallout (Tot, Ivan). Their necessity took the shape of ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network), the network that eventually evolved in infrastructure into the modern-day Internet. January 1st, 1983, is what most consider the creation of the modern internet. Until that point, most computers did not have a standardized method of communication with one another. A new protocol was established, Transfer Control Protocol/Internetwork Protocol (TCP/IP) (Weaving the Web). This allowed different kinds of computers to \"talk\" with one another, regardless of the network. ARPANET and the Defense Dept. officially sanctioned TCP/IP as standard on Jan 1st, 1983, marking the birth of the \"internet.\" Fast forward about six years, and Berners-Lee comes into the picture. During the time, several other companies were attempting to capitalize on the newly regulated internet. They created private networks similar to television, which required a subscription to join and navigate. This resulted in a risk of proprietary software becoming necessary to navigate the internet. Berners-Lee noticed this risk and decided to take action. He developed a royalty-free network instead. At CERN, he integrated the preexisting TCP/IP and Hypertext technologies and created the first \"World Wide Web.\"  Berners-Lee published the first website, which was self-serving (White Paper for the Web of Things). The website described the world wide web and how to use it and invited collaborators to build on the technology. </p> <p>During the creation of the WC3, TBL decided to found a system of governance that relied on open-source development and transparency with its community. Although he founded the WC3 as an initiative attached to CERN, it quickly became an independent organization. Tim Berners-Lee's motivations for making the web's technology royalty-free were shaped by his beliefs and values regarding the web and its potential. As the web inventor, Berners-Lee envisioned a decentralized and open platform accessible to all, regardless of background or economic status. He believed that the web could transform society and democratize access to information and that collaboration and community were essential to realizing this potential. Berners-Lee's decision to forgo patents and royalties reflects his vision for the web's future as an open and collaborative platform for innovation(). He recognized that \"patents and royalties could create barriers to entry and limit innovation, particularly for individuals and organizations that lacked the resources to secure and enforce patents\"(TBL, Weaving the Web). By making the web's technology royalty-free, Berners-Lee sought to level the playing field and ensure that anyone could participate in the development and evolution of the web. Furthermore, Berners-Lee recognized that the web's success depended on the contributions of a diverse and global community of developers and users. By removing financial incentives and proprietary control, he sought to encourage collaboration and foster a culture of openness and sharing. This decision helped to create a culture of innovation that has enabled the web to evolve rapidly and adapt to changing technologies and user needs. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has played a crucial role in developing standards and recommendations for the web, helping to ensure interoperability and compatibility across different devices and platforms(White Paper for the Web of Things). The W3C has also been a critical advocate for adopting open and royalty-free technologies, significantly impacting the web's growth over the past several decades.</p> <p>These technologies enabled the web to evolve rapidly and adapt to changing user needs, creating new business and social interaction opportunities. Royalty-free technology has helped promote innovation and competition, allowing a more comprehensive range of developers and organizations to participate in web development. The use of royalty-free technology has also helped to ensure the accessibility of the web, as it reduces barriers to entry and promotes the development of technologies compatible with a wide range of devices and platforms. This has been essential in enabling the web to reach users in developing countries and other areas with limited access to technology(Tot, Ivan). In addition, the use of royalty-free technology has helped to promote a culture of collaboration and sharing within the web development community (Tim Berners-Lee, Wikipedia). This has led to the creation of numerous open-source projects and initiatives, which have helped to advance the state of the art in web development and promote best practices in the field.</p> <p>Recent years have seen challenges to using royalty-free technology in web development. One major challenge has been the emergence of proprietary technologies not subject to the same open and collaborative development processes as royalty-free technologies. These proprietary technologies can limit innovation and stifle competition, as they are often controlled by a single company or organization that has the power to dictate how they are used and developed. Another challenge to royalty-free technology is the potential impact of patent trolls, who acquire patents to extract royalties from those who use the technology. This can create barriers to entry and limit innovation, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises that lack the resources to fight patent infringement lawsuits.</p> <pre><code>\"The implications of these challenges for the future of the web are significant. If proprietary technologies become dominant, the openness and accessibility of the web could be at risk. This could limit the ability of smaller organizations and individuals to participate in web development and could reduce the potential for innovation and competition.\" (TBL, Weaving the Web)\n</code></pre> <p>Similarly, if patent trolls are allowed to continue to extract royalties from web technologies, this could stifle innovation and limit the development of new technologies. It could also lead to increased costs for organizations that use web technologies, as they are forced to pay royalties to multiple patent holders(Halpin, Harry, Patent Pending). To address these challenges, it will be essential to continue promoting royalty-free technologies in web development and to educate users and organizations about the importance of open and collaborative development processes. It may also be necessary to explore alternative patent ownership and enforcement models, such as using patent pools or creating industry-wide standards for patent licensing. By taking these steps, it may be possible to ensure that the web remains an open and accessible platform that benefits all users. These actions are precisely the actions that Berners-Lee took to ensure that the web remained royalty-free and \"friendly.\" Due to his efforts to contain the development of malicious, harmful, or exploitative technologies, TBL has promoted a sense of competition and collaboration that has never been seen in a globally contributed project. Fast-forward almost 40 years since the development of the internet, and it remains open for anyone to use without restrictions.</p> <p>The growth of the internet has had a significant impact on its users. In 1993, there were only around 130 websites, but by 2000, there were over 10 million(April 2023 Web Server Survey). This growth has given users access to a wealth of information and resources that were previously unavailable. The growth of the internet has also led to a significant increase in internet-related jobs. Resume databases, software engineers, and website designers became highly sought after, as every company needed an online presence. By 2000, 2.5 Million Americans made a living directly from the Internet(Reuters). This growth in internet-related jobs has positively impacted the job market. The Internet has had a profound impact on businesses. Companies like Google, Yahoo, and AOL were born online, and many traditional businesses now have an online presence. The Internet has also given consumers access to various resources, including the Library of Congress, online journals, and newspapers. Many technologies were developed in tandem with the internet. For example, Search Engines like Google, Yahoo, and AskJeeves have become household names, with millions of users accessing the internet through them. These browsers have given users easy access to the internet and have been instrumental in the growth of the web. The internet has also revolutionized communication. Email servers like Yahoo, Gmail, and Hotmail have made it easy for people to communicate with each other from anywhere in the world. Chat rooms like AIM and Yahoo chats have also given users new ways to communicate with each other. VOIP, or Voice over Internet Protocol, has made long-distance communication cheaper and more accessible. By 2000, over 50% of Americans used the internet regularly (Perrin). Of that 50%, 70% were adolescents between 18 and 29(). The internet was not an invention for the current generation; it was an invention for the future. The largest adopters of the internet in years to come would not be meant for those whom the invention was created. </p> <p>In conclusion, this research paper has examined the significance of Berners-Lee's founding of the W3C and his decision to make the web's technology royalty-free. It has discussed his vision for a decentralized and open web accessible to all and the potential impact of royalties and patents on developing and adopting web technologies. Furthermore, this research has explored how royalty-free technology has influenced the adoption and growth of the web over the past several decades. It has highlighted the role of the W3C in promoting the adoption of open and royalty-free technologies and ensuring interoperability and compatibility across different devices and platforms. However, this research has also identified challenges to royalty-free technology, such as the emergence of proprietary technologies and the potential impact of patent trolls. These challenges have implications for the future of the web, including the openness, accessibility, and innovation potential of the web. Therefore, this research suggests that it is essential to continue to promote the use of royalty-free technologies in the development of the web and explore alternative models for patent ownership and enforcement. Further research is also needed to examine the potential impact of emerging technologies on the future of the web and the role of governments and other stakeholders in promoting an open and accessible web. In conclusion, the web has the potential to be a platform for innovation, collaboration, and growth for everyone. It is essential to ensure that the web remains an open and accessible platform that benefits all users, regardless of their background or resources.</p> <p>Works Cited</p> <p>\"April 2023 Web Server Survey.\" April 2023 Web Server Survey, Netcraft, 27 Apr. 2023, news.netcraft.com/archives/category/web-server-survey/.

The name he gave is considered to be the beginning of a new era in the Internet world. That era is characterized by communication between devices, that is machine to machine (M2M) communication (Internet of Things History). With the development of computer networks, we have come to the era where the social network of devices is created. With the IoT concept, Things are able to use the Internet as a communication medium with services for exchanging data. When a large number of Things are connected, which will be able to be part of the World Wide Web (WWW), we come to the term Web of Things (WoT), which is the next step in the development of IoT, that is the successor to the IoT concept. The development of IoT did not stop with M2M communication. It is still developing in different directions such as smart cities, agro-culture, animals, etc. Some of the research papers go a step further, where the big data and the web of things are connected, thus achieving the integration of humans, Things, and computers (Zhong et al, 2016). IoT architecture The IoT architecture is not based on one device. It is about sets of devices that collect information in different ways. When talking about IoT, the most considered topic are environments. The prefix \u201csmart\u201d is often found like e.g. smart homes, smart streets, smart parking lots, smart garbage cans, smart cities, etc. Smart environments can be defined as sets (federations) of sensors and actuators designed for house, building, city, transport etc. (Gubbi et al, 2013). Mark Weiser, who is considered as the founder of ubiquitous computing, has defined smart environments as a world of physical objects that are connected with sensors, actuators, displays, other environments over a network that allows interlaced connectivity (Perera et al, 2013). From the highest level, IoT consists of three parts as shown in Figure 1 (Gubbi et al, 2013): Part of devices: Devices or actuators with their communication components integrated with them. Middleware part: The most complex part that implements data processing logic, stores data and provides access to data to users in 882 VOJNOTEHNI\u010cKI GLASNIK / MILITARY TECHNICAL COURIER, 2018, Vol. 66, Issue 4 such a way that they do not care about the architecture of individual devices (actuators). This layer is made up of several parts (Object Abstraction, Service Management, Service Composition) (Botta et al, 2015). Presentation part: This part adjusts to a specific application and performs data display, data management, etc. Figure 1 \u2013 IoT architecture \u0420\u0438\u0441. 1 \u2013 \u0410\u0440\u0445\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0430 \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0435\u0442\u0430 \u0432\u0435\u0449\u0435\u0439 \u0421\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430 1 \u2013 \u0410\u0440\u0445\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0430 \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0435\u0442\u0430 \u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0438 The purpose of the device layer is to process collected mostly analogue data and to send it in the digital form over the network layer to the server layer. The number of connected devices exceeds the number of human population. In 2010, the number of devices was almost twice the number of human population. The architecture of the device (Things) layer should consist of three parts as shown in Figure 2 (Wortmann &amp; Fl\u00fcchter, 2015): Middleware component, parts of software that will allow device management, IoT component, which will collect data such as sensors (actuators), and the components through which communication with the server will occur (communication modules such as Ethernet, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, ZigBee etc.), 883 Tot, I. et al, Fiware: A Web of things development platform, pp.880-899Hardware part, on which the software will be executed and to which the sensors (actuators) will be connected.

In addition to the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) protocol that found application in the IoT concept, other protocols have been also designed, such as: Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP): The first version of the XMPP protocol appeared in 2000. This protocol uses a Transmission Control Protocol(TCP) protocol on the transport layer, and supports two message exchange models, both a request/response (synchronous) model and an advertiser/subscriber (asynchronous) model. The protocol is designed for short messages that are used in fast real-time applications that require small delay, or in presence-based applications. The disadvantage of this protocol is a relatively large overhead (Saint-Andre et al, 2009). Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP Advanced Message Queuing Protocol Specification, Cisco Systems, 2018): AMQP is an application protocol developed in 2003 by John O'Hara, for the needs of banks, and it was officially adopted in 2012 by OASIS (Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards). AMQP uses the TCP protocol on the transport layer, and has an overhead of 8 bytes. It is based on message exchange on the principle of 884 VOJNOTEHNI\u010cKI GLASNIK / MILITARY TECHNICAL COURIER, 2018, Vol. 66, Issue 4 an advertiser/subscriber. This protocol achieves great reliability and ensures that the message is delivered even when the network breaks down. There are three mechanisms that can be used to send messages: at most once, at least once and exactly once (AMQP Advanced Message Queuing Protocol Specification, Cisco Systems, 2018). Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) MQTT is an application protocol designed in 1999 by IBM and standardized in 2013, which has a relatively small overhead, thus providing a possible application on devices with limited resources (memory, processor etc.) such as IoT devices. This protocol, like the HTTP protocol, uses TCP on the transport layer, but has a smaller overhead of 2 or 4 bytes. The protocol uses the principle of advertisers and subscribers. Facebook Messenger application uses this protocol. In terms of security, this protocol uses Transport Layer Security(TLS). Brokers may require a username and a password (Stanford-Clark &amp; Truong, 2013). Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) The main goal of this protocol is to reduce the overhead to a minimum and provide a mechanism that would be used on a large number of devices that have limitations in terms of power, resources and network considerations (low-range networks such as IEEE 802.15.4, Bluetooth, Low Power Wi-Fi). The HTTP protocol was uses as a model for development. It is important to note that CoAP is not a reduced HTTP, but it is a protocol optimized for M2M communication, which supports basic REpresentational State Transfer (REST) functionalities, common with the HTTP protocol. Also, CoAP in some things represents a step forward in comparison to HTTP. It supports multicast, asynchronous messaging and has a mechanism for finding resources (Sharma, 2014), (Shelby, 2014). CoAP is an application protocol that uses two messaging models. It supports the request/response model, as well as the advertiser/subscriber model. Unlike HTTP, it relies on the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) protocol, but above UDP the DTPLS protocol can also be used to increase the security. The most important part of the IoT architecture is the middleware part, because in that part there are services that mediate the communication with devices. In addition, the services provide the necessary data abstraction, storing and exchanging data with other services. In order to provide the ability of communication between different platforms (hardware, computer), Web services use platform independent 885 Tot, I. et al, Fiware: A Web of things development platform, pp.880-899data formats such as EXtensible Mark-up Language (XML) and JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). Two basic types of services are: SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a standard for exchanging structured information using HTTP and XML. It is platform independent, so it can be used on all computer platforms, as well as in all programming languages. The most common way to call the service method is through RPC (Remote Procedure Call) messages, where the client calls the server method and awaits its response. The SOAP protocol is based on WSDL (Web Services Description Language) and UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration) technologies. REST (REpresentational State Transfer) is an architectural style that was designed by Roy Thomas Fielding. Although not a protocol, it uses multiple protocols in its work, such as: HTTP, Uniform Resource Identifier(URI), JSON, and XML. The basis of this style is the HTTP protocol, which is used as a data transfer mechanism, with a limited number of commands such as: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc. It is RESTfull in sense of performance, scalability, simplicity, modularity, visibility, portability and reliability. Regarding the applicability in the IoT architecture, although both types provide similar services, in the specific constraints that are present in the IoT concept, primarily in device constraints, it is more convenient to use the RESTfull architecture (Zeng et al, 2011). Web of Things The foundation of Web (World Wide Web) is the Internet. The initial idea Tim Berners-Lee had for the development of the Web was to enable the interrelationships mechanism between documents in order to exploit and improve the Internet. The Web developed very rapidly and became much more than the exchange of documents. Now the Web is the largest platform that allows the development of Web applications in different domains. It has evolved from static pages, through applications, social networks to the latest stage, which is the social network of the devices, or Web of Things (Raggett, 2015). WoT is a continuation of the IoT concept, which represents its starting point. IoT deals with access modes and communication protocols between Things and services, that is, IoT deals with the vertical structure. Unlike IoT where it is possible to send data from Things to the server and vice versa, WoT deals with the integration of Things into Web, that is, with the horizontal structure (Figure 3). 886 VOJNOTEHNI\u010cKI GLASNIK / MILITARY TECHNICAL COURIER, 2018, Vol. 66, Issue 4 Figure 3 \u2013 Moving from IoT to WoT \u0420\u0438\u0441. 3 \u2013 \u041f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0445\u043e\u0434 \u043e\u0442 \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0435\u0442\u0430 \u0432\u0435\u0449\u0435\u0439 \u043a \u0432\u0435\u0431 \u0432\u0435\u0449\u0435\u0439 \u0421\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430 3 \u2013 \u041f\u0440\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0437 \u0441\u0430 \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0435\u0442\u0430 \u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u0432\u0435\u0431 \u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0438 From Things, we now expect to be accessible through a web protocol such as HTTP, which represents a ticket for the web. The next step that needs to be done is to define a mechanism for using the IoT resources. This mechanism should be Open Source, it must take care of security and needs to be API (Application Programming Interfaces). Things will represent virtual objects that machines and people will be able to access and communicate with them. With the development of the IoT platform, where each platform has its own mechanism, without interaction with other platforms, we will take a step backwards compared to the initial idea that Tim Berners-Lee had when designing the Web. The problem of the development of royalty-free and platform-independent standards has been discovered and there are currently working groups under the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) that deal with the standardization and development of the WoT API since 2015 (White Paper for the Web of Things, 2016). 887 Tot, I. et al, Fiware: A Web of things development platform, pp.880-899In terms of WoT architecture, the idea is that devices are directly linked to Cloud or through their proxies (Figure 4). Figure 4 \u2013 Connecting Things to Web \u0420\u0438\u0441. 4 \u2013 \u0421\u0432\u044f\u0437\u044b\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0432\u0435\u0449\u0435\u0439 \u043d\u0430 \u0432\u0435\u0431 \u0421\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430 4 \u2013 \u041f\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0437\u0438\u0432\u0430\u045a\u0435 \u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u0432\u0435\u0431 Challenges in interconnection IoT It is necessary to create a service architecture that will not be too much demanding for Things, so it would be possible to implement such services with the existing restrictions on Things. Such services should be able to work without an operating system, and with a limit of 8KB of memory. Such restrictions exclude the use of heavyweight Web services such as, for example, SOAP/WSDL (Guinard et al, 2011). A protocol that meets the mentioned restrictions is the HTTP protocol, that is RESTfull architecture, which has basic access methods such as: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE. In addition to this protocol, it is also possible to use the CoAP protocol, which is similar to the HTTP protocol. In order to make the data understandable for machine processing, they need to be in one of the languages that are understandable from the machines perspective, such as XML or JSON. In most existing scenarios, IoT applications coincide, but are not interoperable among themselves. The goal is to harmonize the used data models as well as frameworks to minimize the human interaction in their communication. It is necessary to find an approach so that the data collected from the sensor will be reusable. It is also necessary to ensure that data can be shared (Gyrard, 2015). In order to make Things capable of building complex systems, we need to enable certain APIs that will allow communication with each 888 VOJNOTEHNI\u010cKI GLASNIK / MILITARY TECHNICAL COURIER, 2018, Vol. 66, Issue 4 other through HTTP or CoAP protocols or other protocols, and in this way we will create the WoT (Jara et al, 2014). Currently in Europe, according to Google statistics, most countries have IPv6 present less than 34%, which means that it is still not possible to use all the IPv6 addressing capability (Google IpV6 Statistics). In addition, it is still not possible to expect Things to work as servers that will be able to process all the requests that come to them in terms of resources. These constraints imply the need to think about other ways to access the resources of Things (Barnaghi et al, 2013). In terms of architecture used in the integration of Things, we encounter two types of architectures. The first is Direct Integration that for every Thing assigns an address, and has its own small embedded service. Another architecture is Indirect Integration that refers to Things that are not able to run their own services, but use other services as their proxy, often referred to as the smart gateway (Zeng et al, 2011). Using the CoAP protocol, it is possible to reduce overhead, but the problem of finding resources using the web browser remains. This problem can be solved in several ways (Castron et al, 2016). For Emmanuel Baccelli and Dave Raggett, there are two basic challenges to be solved in the development of the IoT concept. The first is the implementation of the IPv6 protocol at the hardware level of the IoT device. The second problem is providing end-to-end security (Baccelli &amp; Raggett, 2015). In summary, we can conclude that WoT's software architecture should enable: - development of services on devices with limited resources, - M2M communication, - the creation of a data model that will be suitable for processing and reuse, - an API that will allow resources to be visible from other services, - secure communication. In order to be able to implement these requirements independently (without using the IoT platform), we need to have a team of at least several people, who will work for several years (IoT Platforms The central backbone for the Internet of Things, 2015). This points to the need to use existing platforms, or middleware. Using middleware, which implements the mentioned requirements, we can save the time it takes to create our own applications. There are currently a large number of IoT platforms, and most of them are commercial. Large companies such as Amazon, Google, 889 Tot, I. et al, Fiware: A Web of things development platform, pp.880-899Microsoft, IBM etc. are present in the field of IoT platforms. One of the Open Source platforms that provides these requirements is FIWARE, which can be used in different scenarios, using open and free APIs. Open Source FIWARE platform FIWARE is a platform that has a layer of infrastructure, and provides the IaaS service. In addition to IaaS, the platform also provides PaaS service features. These service functionalities that the platform offers enable the development of our own IoT applications. The platform is also possible to host on your own hardware, but this feature is out of scope of this paper. The FIWARE platform allows the creation of virtual machines in which we can create our own architecture for the IoT application. Also, the platform frees us from taking care of hardware, which makes it easier for developers to create a service for a specific application. In terms of security, it is possible to define the security police, which will take care of security and access to the application. Security of frontend and backend parts is achieved using the OAuth2 protocol. The basis for the functioning of the FIWARE platform is the Open API Next Generation Service Interface (NGSI). NGSI defines data model, context data interface, context availability interface. Currently, two versions of this interface have been implemented, NGSI9 and NGSI10. (FIWARE-NGSI v2 Specification). A particularly important part for the functioning of the interface is the data model. It consists of three parts: Context Entities: It is an entity that can represent any Thing like a sensor, an actuator, a human, an animal, a car, etc. Each entity must have its own ID. To enable later search by type, you need to assign a type attribute. Context Attributes: These are attributes that make up an entity. These attributes, besides their name, have additional attributes that describe the entity. These attributes are value, type and metadata that further describe the attribute. Context metadata: As mentioned before, it is an optional attribute. It consists of the basic three parts (name, type, value). The NGSI interface allows the data to be accessed through the REST method, whereby the data can be displayed in the JSON or XML format. The developers are free of concern about the communication protocols IoT uses, thanks to the IoT Generic Enablers (GE), which 890 VOJNOTEHNI\u010cKI GLASNIK / MILITARY TECHNICAL COURIER, 2018, Vol. 66, Issue 4 translate all data that comes from Things into the NGSI form, with which developers can then work. The software architecture of the platform is based on Generic Enablers (GE), which are elements that build the FIWARE platform. GEs can be added depending on the needs of a specific application, and a list of all GEs is available through the FIWARE catalogue. The FIWARE platform enables integration of more services. Data can be exchanged using the NGSI API. The service architecture is based on the REST style, where resources are accessed based on their names, using URI. In this way, the horizontal interaction with other systems is achieved, hence we come to the infrastructure that can provide the development of Web of Things. Also, the infrastructure has mechanisms for generating and using Big Data. By using additional metadata attributes, we can achieve the infrastructure for semantic web development (Start Using FIWARE Right Now, 2018). Example of using the FIWARE platform An example that will serve us for testing the FIWARE platform is based on reading the values from the sensor, and the actuation of the DC motor depending on the values from the sensor. The goal we want to achieve by this example is to connect the hardware of some Thing with the service, which will be used for management, and that part will represent the IoT domain. The next functionality we want to explore is the ability to access Things over the Web browser and gain value in order to check the possibility to integrate into the Web. In this way, we want to test the functionalities that the FIWARE platform provides in the WoT domain. In the testing stage, we will use the ATMega2560 microcontroller, through which we will collect data from the sensors, as well as starting the activity to check the communication on both sides. Communication between hardware and services will be achieved over the Internet. To connect the hardware to the Internet, we will use the Wi-Fi module ESP8266 (Figure 5). Both virtual sensor, as well as a virtual actuator, will be described using the JSON format. We will describe the sensor with the basic attributes such as ID, type, owner, hardware, location, temperature, humidity. When creating a virtual sensor, we can enter the default values. The sensor description is shown in Figure 6. 891 Tot, I. et al, Fiware: A Web of things development platform, pp.880-899 Figure 5 \u2013 Components of the example \u0420\u0438\u0441. 5 \u2013 \u041a\u043e\u043c\u043f\u043e\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0442\u044b \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0430 \u0421\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430 5 \u2013 \u041a\u043e\u043c\u043f\u043e\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0430 The state attribute refers to the status of the actuator, whether it is turned on or not, while the speed attribute represents the current motor speed. In the later physical realization, for easier display, the speed attribute will be represented by the number of LEDs that will signal the speed at which the motor is currently running. The listed attributes will allow us to map real Things into virtual ones that will live on the Web as separate entities (Figure 7). When the entities are created, using the NGSI API, we have to connect hardware (Things) to them, and then use the virtual sensor or actuator. A physical sensor should send data to a virtual sensor in order to have an image of the device in real time. The virtual sensor is located at the following address: http://130.206.xxx.xxx:1026/v2/entities/Sensor-01/. 892 VOJNOTEHNI\u010cKI GLASNIK / MILITARY TECHNICAL COURIER, 2018, Vol. 66, Issue 4 Figure 6 \u2013 Model of a sensor \u0420\u0438\u0441. 6 \u2013 \u041c\u043e\u0434\u0435\u043b\u044c \u0434\u0430\u0442\u0447\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0421\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430 6 \u2013 \u041c\u043e\u0434\u0435\u043b \u0441\u0435\u043d\u0437\u043e\u0440\u0430 Unlike the sensor that updates the virtual sensor, the actuator monitors the state of its virtual entity, and, depending on its condition, adjusts its state. The virtual actuator is located at the following address: http://130.206.xxx.xxx:1026/v2/entities/Actuator-01/. After connecting, the data on the server represent the real state of the device, and are available through the Web browser in the JSON format. Figure 8 shows the virtual actuator data. Based on the data, we can conclude that our motor is started and running at speed 2. 893 Tot, I. et al, Fiware: A Web of things development platform, pp.880-899 Figure 7 \u2013 Architecture of the example \u0420\u0438\u0441. 7 \u2013 \u0410\u0440\u0445\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0430 \u0421\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430 7 \u2013 \u0410\u0440\u0445\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0430 As the data is available via the Web browser, it is possible to manage actuators, or read values from the sensors using our own applications, and to connect with other sources. In our case, the idea is that when the temperature exceeds a certain value, the actuation of a small motor at a certain speed is carried out. Another advantage of the FIWARE platform is the use of GE, such as the CEP (Complex Event Processing)., We will use this GE to monitor the state of the sensor, and to start the actuator. A practical example is given in Figure 9. 894 VOJNOTEHNI\u010cKI GLASNIK / MILITARY TECHNICAL COURIER, 2018, Vol. 66, Issue 4 Figure 8 \u2013 JSON model of the actuator \u0420\u0438\u0441. 8 \u2013 \u0408\u0421\u041e\u041d \u043c\u043e\u0434\u0435\u043b\u044c \u0430\u043a\u0442\u0443\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0430 \u0421\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430 8 \u2013 \u0408\u0421\u041e\u041d \u043c\u043e\u0434\u0435\u043b \u0430\u043a\u0442\u0443\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0430 Figure 9 \u2013 Practical example \u0420\u0438\u0441. 9 \u2013 \u041f\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0435\u0440 \u0438\u0437 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0438 \u0421\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430 9 \u2013 \u041f\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0430\u043d \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0435\u0440 895 Tot, I. et al, Fiware: A Web of things development platform, pp.880-899Conclusion Based on the presented theory and a practical example, we can conclude that the FIWARE platform allows us to create virtual devices (Things) that will reflect the state of the physical devices (Things), which have computational constraint (8KB memory). This virtual representation of the devices (Things) is displayed in a platform independent JSON format that allows later processing, and is available using the REST methods. This system architecture allows us to manage devices (Things), that is, to use their resources by looking at them as services. The most important feature is that these resources are available using the Web protocol. The developers are free from concern about the complexity of device management (Things), using a virtual representation of the devices (Things). This functionality enables easier use in future applications. The FIWARE platform is based on an open API, so when WoT API is created by the W3C some time in the future, it will probably be implemented on the FIWARE platform as well. Until then, the FIWARE platform provides the ability to create and test WoT applications, using the APIs that provide the necessary functionality for implementing the WoT concept.

Weiser* The Internet continues to transform the information industries and challenge intellectual property law to develop a competition policy strategy to regulate networked products. In particular, inventors of \u201cinformation plat- forms\" that support the viewing of content\u2014be they instant messaging sys- tems, media players, or Web browsers\u2014face a muddled set of legal doctrines that govern the scope of available intellectual property protection. This un\u2014 certainty reflects a fundamental debate about what conditions will best facili- tate innovation in the information industries\u2014a debate most often played out at the conceptual extremes between the \u201ccommons\u201d and \u201cproprietary con- trol\u201d approaches to the Internet and intellectual property policy.</p> <p>This Article proposes a \u201ccompetitive platforms mode \" as a new concep- tual framework to govern intellectual property and Internet policy. This model suggests that where information platforms will continue to face com- petitive alternatives, intellectual property law and policy should encourage competition among them as a means of driving companies to develop supe- rior products and enabling them to appropriate rewards from their inven- tions. Alternatively, where a particular information platform merges as the dominant one\u2014for example, in the case of Microsoft Windows in the market for PC operating systems\u2014intellectual property protection against the reverse engineering of its platform standard or user interface should recede. As a strategy to implement the competitive platforms model, this Article proposes a reformulation of the fair use and misuse principles\u2014as developed in both. copyright and patent law-\u2014-to provide a unified, clear, and coherent frame- work for protecting platform standards and user interfaces. Moreover, the competitive platforms model calls upon industry standard\u2014setting bodies and the federal government to reassume the critical coordination and funding roles they served in the early days of the Internet in order to support the development of the parts of the Internet\u2019s information infrastructure that are intrinsically open to all and thus are vulnerable to underinvestment.</p> <ul> <li>Associate Professor, University of Colorado School of Law and Department of Interdisciplinary Telecommunications.

One vision, often associated with Lawrence Lessig, suggests that the Internet should be an \u201cinformation commons\" built on open source technologies.l Resisting this call for a categorical commitment to openness, others champion a proprietary de- velopment model along the lines of Microsoft\u2019s role in the computer op- erating systems market.2 This Article rejects both perspectives, proposing a \u201ccompetitive platforms model\u201d to guide intellectual property policy in the Internet age. This model embraces proprietary development where there is competition between rival platform standards, but calls for open standards where a single platform standard wins out or where rival \ufb01rms would not seek to invent a proprietary standard at all.</p> <p>The competitive platforms model both recognizes the signi\ufb01cance of the Internet's nonproprietary roots and seeks to facilitate the proprietary investment that will help shape the Internet\u2019s future. The Internet devel- oped in a nonproprietary environment in which the US. government supported and a disparate array of developers contributed to its growth without focusing on pro\ufb01ts. Notably, this environment produced the In- ternet\u2019s basic standard\u2014the Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)\u2014that facilitates the routing of Internet communica- tions and enables the Internet to function as a \"network of networks.\"3 To this date, this basic platform standard remains nonproprietary: \u201cNo one owns [it], no one licenses its use, and no one restricts access to it.\"4 I.

As others have explained, Lessig's vision of a commons\u2014as well as his criticisms of proprietaty control\u2014is ultimately nuanced, but his prose tends to suggest a black or white choice.

In its last encounter with this issue in the Lotus case several years ago, the Supreme Court divided equally, af- \ufb01rming without an opinion the First Circuit's decision not to protect such an interface.14 Regulating access through intellectual property rules presents a formidable challenge for judicially developed doctrine because computer programs are eligible for protection under both copyright\u2014as creative works of authorship\u2014and patent\u2014as items of functional util- ity.15 To be sure, both copyright and patent law include certain doctrines that limit property rights and aim to strike the right balance between pro- viding incentives to innovate and ensuring access to critical standards. But these doctrines remain muddled, in part because of the unresolved debate between the commons and proprietary control perspectives, and thus are in need of a clear analytical framework to ensure that they serve sound competition policy goals.</p> </li> </ol> <p>With the increasing importance of the Internet, the unresolved state of intellectual property rules governing access to platform standards will become even more signi\ufb01cant. In particular, the Internet promises to reshape the information industries16 in its image by enabling numerous products to use its communications standard to provide new services, such as instant messaging, that rely on its platform standard.17 Conse- quently, the conceptual framework used for deciding when \ufb01rms can code). In the language often used by courts interpreting the Copyright Act, this issue boils down to the protectibility of literal copying of \u201cnon-literal\u201d elements of a software program.

With respect to dynamic software markets, however, the length of protection is often irrelevant, as patent law's twenty-year duration is an eternity in the Internet world. Rather than focus on the length of intellectual property protection, this Article focuses on its scope; in particular, it discusses when software product speci\ufb01cations and user interfaces should be protected so that other \ufb01rms cannot make their products interoperable with the protected inventions.</p> </li> <li> <p>While the precise de\ufb01nition of \u201cthe information industries\u201d remains unsettled, for purposes of this Article the term refers to Internet services, telecommunications senrices, and software products.

In evaluating al- ternative frameworks to guide intellectual property policy, courts and policymakers will need to determine what approach will best facilitate in- novation in the development of the Internet in particular and the infor- mation industries more generally.</p> </li> </ol> <p>This Article presents an alternative model to the commons and pro- prietary control perspectives, setting out the competitive platforms model and explaining how it can be applied to the Internet and the information industries. In terms of its application to the lntemet, the competitive platforms model would ensure a basic level of openness while allowing for proprietary enhancements, thereby enabling developers to provide ri- val Internet-based products and services based on technologies that are not open to all.\u201d Under this model, the technologies that make these services possible would be protected (and access limited) until and unless a particular one emerged as dominant and likely to monopolize the mar- ket. By that time, the innovating firm would already have reaped suffi\u2014 cient rewards to have spurred the innovation; conversely, a failure to open a dominant standard would threaten future innovation by denying access to \ufb01rms that needed to rely on this standard to bring new products to market.</p> <p>Based on the competitive platforms model, this Article proposes a reformulation of the intellectual property law doctrines that regulate the copying of user interfaces or platform standards (often accomplished through reverse engineering). Admittedly, reformulating intellectual property policy into a uni\ufb01ed and coherent regime based on the competi- tive platforms model is only one component of a more comprehensive vision for the regulation of the Internet and information industries. In essence. the competitive platforms model calls for a policy of facilitating. wherever possible. the development and continued survival of rival plat- form standards (or \u201cinformation platforms\u201d\u201d\u2019) to support different infor\u2014 mation products and services. Where multiple platforms cannot thrive\u2014 and where one appears set to dominate the market\u2014the next best world is one where different firms can all sunive based on a common and open standard. As this Article explains, rival standards provide a number of bene\ufb01ts over a single open standard\u2014that is to say, one not owned by a proprietary \ufb01rm\u2014but a single open standard is better than a single pro\u2014 Is. In practice. these enhanced proprietary services could provide advantages over current Internet communications, such as heightened security, guaranteed delivery. and synchronization (for realtime applications).

AN INTRODUCTION To THE INTERNET AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY POLICY The development of the Internet and the continuing need to facili- tate and regulate its growth have set the tone for current debates about the information economy and the future of intellectual property policy. To explain the backdrop for these debates, this Part \ufb01rst discusses brie\ufb02y how the Internet has developed thus far and how it functions, and then connects the development of the Internet to intellectual property policy. It concludes by outlining the legal treatment of reverse engineering, which is one means of regulating when an inventor of an information platform can maintain proprietary control of a platform standard.</p> <p>A. How the Internet Works and How It Got Started One helpful conceptualization of the Internet\u2019s technical architec- ture is to think of it as four layers that are piled on top of one another.20 At the top is the content layer, which is the level at which most users interact with the Internet (Yahoo\u2019s website, for example). Supporting 20. Models such as this have been developed to help describe the different functional \u201clayers\u201d of Internet communication. See, e.g., IT-Director.com, TCP/IP and OS], searchNemorking.com, Sept. 26, 2002, at http2//searchNetworking.techtarget.com/ originalContent/O,289142,sid7_gci851291,00.html (on \ufb01le with the Columbia Law Retn'ew) (describing the ISO/OSI and TCP/IP reference models). Increasingly, legal commentators rely on a four-layer model to conceptualize the Internet\u2019s architecture. See, e.g., Kevin Werbach. A layered Model for Internet Policy, l J. Telecomms. 8c High Tech. L. 37. 58\u201464 (2002).542 COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW [VoI. 103:534 this content layer is the application layer, which includes the browser software to access websites and the media player software for multimedia. At the Internet\u2019s core is the logical layer, which consists of the basic stan- dards\u2014namely, the TCP/IP\u2018Zl\u2014that de\ufb01ne the nature of Internet com- munications. Finally, at bottom, the Internet relies on the physical layer, which involves the actual wires that are used to access the Internet and the \u201cbackbone\" infrastructure that carries information from where it is stored to the user.</p> <p>Using the four-layer model of the Internet set out above, it becomes clear why legal scholars and most commentators have spent a dispropor- tionate amount of attention focusing on the role that intellectual prop- erty law plays in regulating access to content over the lntemet. For most users, the content layer of the Internet, along with the physical layer, is the most familiar and understandable. But the roles played by the appli- cations and logical layers, while not appreciated by most users, are criti- cally important. Indeed, the available applications and logical standards constitute the Internet\u2019s software infrastructure and make possible its va- rious uses. Thus, rather than address the content and physical layer is- sues that Iie at the heart of many current academic and policy debates regarding the Internet,22 this Article focuses on how intellectual property law and government policy can influence the future development of the application and logical layers.</p> <p>The openness of each layer of the Internet reflects not only the vi- sion of its early pioneers and its government supporters,23 but also the leadership of standard-setting committees like the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).2\u201c To develop the basic Internet technologies, the 21.

Information Platforms and Reverse Engineering Information technology inventions at the application and logical lay- ers of the Internet\u2014or in the equivalent positions of other information industries\u2014can be understood as information platforms.\u201d Stated sim- ply, applications and logical standards constitute information platforms because they provide a foundation for the delivery of content\u2014be it mu- sic, text, video games, or video\u2014in digital form. In nearly all cases, this platform relies on complementary products or services that use a plat- form standard or user interface. Take, for example, Sony PlayStation\u2019s video game system. This product, which can be understood as an applica- tion, supports content speci\ufb01cally made for it. Similarly, both a Web browser and a media player program function in this manner, as they facilitate the viewing of content in a compatible format. The essence of each of these information platforms is the platform standard for which content can be built, and the user experience created by its user interface.</p> <p>By understanding how the browser, media player, and the Sony Play- Station all constitute applications, it also becomes clearer how the logical layer standards play a critical role in facilitating invention. Because all Internet users rely on connections that are compatible with the basic technologies comprising the logical layer\u2014and those technologies are free and open to all\u2014inventors like Sony can develop interactive applica- tions without worrying about whether they will have access to the basic Internet standard. At the same time, because there is no one custodian charged with maintaining the logical layer standards, there is a danger that those standards may not develop as effectively as the proprietary ap- plications that rely upon them.</p> <p>For companies developing proprietary applications that function as information platforms, protecting their platform standard and user inter- voting, public notice requirements, and hierarchical comment-and\u2014review cycles afford \ufb01rms multiple opportunities to delay a standard's progress); O\ufb01ice of Policy Planning, Fed.

Where gov- ernment decides to provide for intellectual property protection to en- courage invention, it must be careful to calibrate the investment incen- tives awarded to developers so as to limit the ability of inventors to prevent innovation by denying access to would-be improvers and rivals.37 Even though companies have long developed products on a proprie- tary basis in the software industry, intellectual property law has yet to set- tle on a coherent model of when to allow open access to an information platform for purposes of developing a similar product. This access can occur either because intellectual property law declines to protect user interfaces or because it allows access to a platform standard through re- verse engineering. As de\ufb01ned by a leading case, reverse engineering can be understood as the process of using a \ufb01nished product and working backward to determine how it was actually made.38 In the case of software programs, reverse engineering is used to translate a program written in object code (that is, the machine-readable language or binary code of ones and zeros that tells the computer what functions to per- form) to source code (which programmers can read and understand) .39 Market Failure and Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma in Intellectual Property, 17 U.

Unfortunately, as Coase\u2019s theorem and subsequent scholarship make clear, transaction costs and imperfect information may well prevent many such resolutions from taking place.46 Moreover, as reverse engi- neering can be quite complicated, the legal permission to do so may be insuf\ufb01cient to enable \ufb01rms to gain access to a platform standard. In such cases, either antitrust action or telecommunications regulation may be necessary to ensure such access.47 C. Intellectual Property Law and the Development of Platform Standards Intellectual property law enjoys an important advantage over anti- trust and regulation in deciding when to allow or prevent open access to a platform standard because it operates only as a check on private con- duct, not as an af\ufb01rmative regulatory regime that superintends access ob- ligations. This advantage of intellectual property law stems from the nonrivalrous nature of intellectual property (i.e., it can be used by many at the same time), such that allowing open access to it does not present any of the management problems associated with the \u201ctragedy of the commons\u201d scenario.48 The risk in developing an intellectual property re-</p> </li> <li> <p>For a discussion of this point, see Annabelle Gawer 8c Michael A.

In that case, the court analyzed a challenge to Microsoft\u2019s dominance in the operating systems market. Ultimately, through antitrust law, the Department of Justice, a number of litigating states, and Microsoft settled on a set of access remedies.53 Such access opportunities, however, might also have been available through intellec- tual property law to the extent that it did not limit opportunities for po- tentially successful reverse engineering. In fact, intellectual property law does not regulate reverse engineering in a consistent manner because patent law tends to be quite restrictive of it and copyright law quite lib- eral, even where the same computer software product is protectible within both regimes.54 Understood properly, intellectual property law can de\ufb01ne the nature of a \ufb01rm\u2019s ownership rights in an information plat- form (including permitting access where appropriate), and antitrust and telecommunications regulation can further limit those rights where the theoretical possibility of access (through reverse engineering) does not occur in practice.55 In the Microsoft case, it may well have been the prac- tical obstacles to reverse engineering the operating system that rein- forced Microsoft\u2019s dominance, but the lack of a more sensible intellectual property regime did not help matters.56 Intellectual property law also enjoys an advantage over antitrust and telecommunications regulation in regulating access to would-be domi- nant information platforms because reverse engineering acts as a self- help opportunity for \ufb01rms that may otherwise be defeated in the market- place before a conduct remedy (overseen either by a regulatory agency or</li> <li> <p>See United States v.

Just recently, RealNetworks announced that it had reverse-engineered Microsoft\u2019s rival Windows Media Player in order to ensure that users could use the RealPlayer for any content developed for the Media Player.57 This step can be understood either as an offensive effort to appropriate the value of Microsoft\u2019s system or as a defensive measure to stay alive.58 By condoning defensive measures, intellectual property law can protect \ufb01rms that need access to a would\u2014be dominant standard without the delay inherent in an antitrust action. Conversely, by refusing to provide access where two or more rival products are both sus- tainable competitors, intellectual property law can provide important in- centives for investment and experimentation between competing infor- mation platforms.</p> </li> </ol> <p>ll.

To that end, commentators have offered a number of alternative conceptions to guide these doctrines. As to the fair use principle, many courts and commentators have suggested that an economics-based ap- proach should guide the analysis.86 This approach, along with the four (noting that Borland's commercial appeal lay not in its copying of Lotus's menu, but in its added features).</p> </li> <li> <p>See generally Maureen A.

Thus, the crucial\u2014and potentially limiting\u2014factor is how broadly to construe the relevant protection conferred by patent or copyright. This issue remains unsettled, with some courts allowing for reverse engineering (at least in the copyright misuse context) even where it involved actual copying of the protected work itself.

In the horizontal case, the relevant access right would be between a rival information platform\u2014say, Microsoft\u2014and AOL. In the vertical situa- tion, the offering of an interoperable application will generally be unob- jectionable because, as a complementary good, it will add to the value of the network.101 Not surprisingly, AOL (like other information platform owners) acts quite favorably toward companies who provide complemen- tary applications for their instant messaging system, providing them with royalty-free access to their system, while it resists cooperation with rivals like Microsoft.102 Consequently, the potential cost of providing access to a developer of a complementary application is considerably less, and the rationale for allowing reverse engineering (as a reasonable default rule) is quite strong.103</p> </li> <li> <p>In advocating a sui generis regime for protecting computer software, however, Professor Samuelson did, albeit in a footnote, make this distinction.

Most of these cases have involved vertical access issues where a manufacturer of a game wants to copy the protected standard as part of a reverse engineering process to ensure that its games will work on the system.\u201d\u2019\u201c In those cases, courts have regularly held as a noninfring\u2014 ing use any copying of the standard that enables companies to create products that make the information platform more valuable and do not compete with existing games. \u201d\u20195 A second set of cases involves horizontal access issues where an entrant wants to ensure that its system is compati- ble with an established one\u2014such as in cases where a new system is de- signed so that it can play games made for a competitor\u2019s system.\u201c\"\" In horizontal access cases, the competitive effects of the copying are quite different from the vertical access cases, but courts and commentators have yet to translate the competition policy principles that govern such scenarios into legal doctrine.</p> </li> </ol> <p>For a sense of how the different theoretical frameworks of the com- mons and proprietary control models can in\ufb02uence intellectual property law, consider the recent case of Sony Computer Entertainment, Inc. v.

Putting the Reverse Engineering Debate in Context Before using the competitive platforms model to develop an appro- priate conception of how intellectual property law should treat reverse engineering, it is important to explain that this model leaves untouched three important facets of current law (as developed under the fair use principle). First, vertical access\u2014which involves products that are com- plementary to an information platform\u2014should not be restricted. Sec- ond, cases involving the ability to transfer user-created applications (such as word processing files, for example) from one system to another also should not be restricted. Finally, because the relevant intellectual prop- erty issue in reverse engineering cases will often be the legality of the copying of the protected standard in the \ufb01rst place (as opposed to the</p> </li> <li> <p>17 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201(l).</p> </li> <li> <p>See id. \u00a7 1201(l)(l) (protecting reverse engineering only \u201cto the extent any such acts of identi\ufb01cation and analysis do not constitute infringement under this title\u201c).</p> </li> <li> <p>As the Rtimerdes case demonstrates, the line. between legitimate and illegitimate reverse engineering may not always be easy to draw.

Alternatively, to the extent that the use of DRM technologies prevents reverse engineers from gaining relatively manageable access to would\u2014be protected standards. this will increase the pressure on antitrust and regulation to address such access questions.2003] IN'IELLECTUAL PROPERTY POLICY 565 rival product itself), courts will face challenging remedial questions re- garding the propriety of injunctive relief. This section will address each point in turn.</p> </li> </ol> <p>First, with respect to the difference between horizontal and vertical access, intellectual property law currently appreciates the difference be- tween complementary and substitutable goods, and thus generally allows access for the creation of complementary goods.\u20182\u2018 On this rationale, for example, the fair use principle authorizes reporters to quote from pri- mary sources without \ufb01rst having to seek permission. By contrast, intel- lectual property law generally does not allow a competitor to appropriate a creator\u2019s achievement without paying any fee as a license to use the proprietary standard.122 Second, the importance of protecting information platform innova- tions should not extend to enabling a \ufb01rm to bene\ufb01t from investments made by users of the product (as opposed to by the producer). This dis- tinction between user investments and producer investments is the differ- ence between the value of a set of word processing documents created by the user and an innovative user interface, invented by the producer, that makes the product easier to use. Microsoft, for example, initially devel- oped a spreadsheet program (Excel) that could read macros created by users for Lotus 1-2-3, and a word processing program (Word) that could read documents originally produced on WordPerfect. Signi\ufb01cantly, Microsoft\u2019s product\u2014unlike some others\u2014did not copy Lotus\u2019s user in- terface, but was compatible with Lotus\u2019s product in that it would give users the ability to use the Lotus commands, would read its \ufb01les, and could use its macros.\u201823 To avoid protecting investments such as a user\u2019s creation of her own \ufb01les and macros, intellectual property law should distinguish between two forms of open access: access to a user interface or the product\u2019s essential standard\u2014cloning\u2014that may be objectionable from a competition policy standpoint, and access to the program speci\ufb01- cations that will allow users to rely on converters or adapters that enable their creations to be transferred to other systems\u2014compatibility\u2014that will generally be unobjectionable.I24 121. For a cogent explanation of this principle, see Ty, Inc. v. Publ\u2019ns Int'l Ltd., 292 F.3d 512, 517\u201418 (7th Cir. 2002).</p> <ol> <li> <p>To be more precise, the reverse engineering right may place an upper bound on the amount of the potential license: A would-be licensee will not pay more than it would cost to reverse engineer the product to gain the sought-after access. See Cohen 8: Lemley, supra note 71, at 18; Samuelson 8c Scotchmer, supra note 39, at 1589. In reality, there may well be other bene\ufb01ts that the inventor can provide in addition to access to the standard (forms of technical assistance, for example), so the cost of reverse engineering may often be a \ufb02oor, not a ceiling, for a licensing fee.

Structural Software, Inc., 26 F.3d 1335, 1343\u201444 (5th Cir. 1994) (making the clone-compatibility distinction). Because there is no clear and consistent technology in this area, there is plenty of opportunity for confusion. See566 COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 103:534 Where the value of the overall standard is not intrinsic to that inven- tion, but instead relates only to the user's investment in it\u2014say, the crea- tion of word processing documents\u2014allowing access to product speci\ufb01ca- tions that will support a different product (as opposed to a clone built on the same user interface and functionalities) may be, asjoseph Farrell put it, \u201cthe only commercially reasonable way to compete.\u201d125 Thus, intellec- tual property law should condone reverse engineering used to gain access to the product speci\ufb01cations (for compatibility purposes), but be more careful in evaluating when a rival is permitted to appropriate a proprie- tary standard or user interface (cloning). In so doing, intellectual prop- erty law can both protect investment incentives and allow for a smoothly functioning market where user investments will not necessarily determine the success of a system just because it came first.</p> </li> </ol> <p>In many cases, the difference between access to the basic platform standard itself and facilitating compatibility with it will be the difference between a user interface and a product interface. User interfaces or plat- form standards de\ufb01ne how the software and the user interact;I26 product interfaces enable programmers to design software so that it can work with other software.127 Whether a rival reverse engineers a platform standard or simply copies the basic user interface, this appropriation goes to the essence of the invention at issue. Thus, where alternative user interfaces or platform standards can be viable competitors and where their develop- ment requires real innovation, courts should protect rival user interfaces or standards.\u201828 In many cases, a private \ufb01rm may itself allow fairly liberal Kenneth W.

THE CURRENT BATTLE IN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY THEORY: THE COMMONS MODEL VERSUS PROPRIETARY CONTROL Intellectual property protection constitutes a \ufb01rst line of competition policy that provides open access to information platforms. By making access more dif\ufb01cult, intellectual property law can, like antitrust, discour- age cooperation where competition would lead to more innovation and consumer choice. Altematively, by allowing access (as in the Connectix case\u2018S\u201c), intellectual property law affords companies a self-help remedy that facilitates open access without the regulatory intervention character\u2014 ized by antitrust or telecommunications regulation.135 How intellectual property law should function in this regard continues to spark heated debates between advocates of the commons and proprietary control mod- els, each of which pushes for very different approaches. In particular, commons advocates point to the spectacular growth of the Internet based on open source technologies, claiming that this growth could never have occurred against a backdrop of proprietary standards. By contrast, the proprietary control model underscores that a dominant \ufb01rm may be able to develop a uniform and continually evolving platform standard that can push the industry forward. This Part evaluates these claims, highlighting the shortcomings of each.</li> </ol> <p>A.

In particular, some argue that these institutions allow for a \u201cbottom-up\u201d system of norms and traditions that should replace current legal tools, such as intellectual property laws.148 just recently, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), a group that endorses standards for the Web, took a commons model approach, concluding that patented technologies would not be permitted in that group\u2019s of\ufb01cial standards.'49 To the extent that the W3C is able to de- velop new standards without recognizing proprietary ownership\u2014and li- censing fees\u2014for Internet technologies, it will offer a model of how the commons approach can govern an Internet where proprietary ownership is neither necessary nor desirable.150 The commons model rests in part on the \u201cpath dependence\" theory that network markets will almost invariably rely on a single standard. On this view, an information technology standard may become dominant not because of its relative merits and greater degree of technological sophisti- cation, but because it came \ufb01rst.151 Among economists, there is an ongo- ing debate over which (if any) markets re\ufb02ect this phenomenon, with the case study of the standard for keyboards\u2014the choice of the \u201cQWERTY\u201d over the \u201cDvorak\u201d model\u2014being a topic of notable disagreement.152 note 145, at 816 (\u201cStronger appropriability will not yield more innovation in all contexts and, where it does, innovation may come at excessive cost\u201d).</p> <ol> <li> <p>See Elkin-Koren, supra note 48, at 1158\u201479 (detailing a potential shift to \u201cprivate ordering\" regimes in cyberspace).</p> </li> <li> <p>The debate over this issue is well documented at the World Wide Web Consortium's Patent Policy Working Group homepage.

As such, proprietary \ufb01rms expect to recoup substantial returns from their work and do not release the source code of their products for free (or at all, in most cases). Not surprisingly, such \ufb01rms challenge the open source movement as foolhardy and counterproductive.\u20187\" l.

Schumpeter\u2018s early work, while also focused on innovation, suggested that small entrepreneurs are critical to facilitating the advance of technology.

In the Internet context, both the Clinton Administration\u2019s embrace of strong intellectual property protection in the e-commerce area and the endorsement of the so-called \u201cbusiness method patents\" re\ufb02ect this perspective.\u201879 In particular, this vision places a premium on ensuring that \ufb01rms reap proprietary rewards for innovating in the Internet environment. On this view, proprietary con- trol of intellectual property does not simply provide the important incen- tive to invent new technologies, but also ensures that such technologies are maintained carefully and put to their best use.180 Relying on proprietary development provides a clear answer to a po- tential weakness of the open source model: It boasts a clear ability to develop and deploy talented leadership and coordination to ensure that a standard does not fragment within a wide user base.

First, although monopolies such as IBM and Microsoft may be dethroned at some point, the exercise of monopoly power in the meantime\u2014which may well be several decades\u2014still can injure consumers.\u201893 In the case of Microsoft, its ability to maintain and control closed, de facto industry standards\u2014as opposed to open, de jure ones endorsed by standard-setting commit- tees\u2014has enabled it to exercise great in\ufb02uence over other companies. In particular, Microsoft has used this control to undermine support for Sun Microsystems\u2019s open java standard.194 A second, and more fundamental, criticism of the proprietary con- trol model is that numerous studies have shown that incumbent monopo- lies will often fail to develop and deploy radically new technologies,195</p> </li> <li> <p>See Samuel Kortum 8c josh Lerner, Assessing the Contribution of Venture Capital to Innovation, 31 RAND]. Econ. 674, 676\u201481 (2000) (providing statistical evidence of the importance of venture funding on patent activity). As to smaller \ufb01rms, however, it may well be the case that patents and intellectual property provide an important incentive and means of justifying their value.

Although it could be the case that venture capital \ufb01rms appreciate the presence of patents as a psychological bene\ufb01t even if they have minimal actual market impact, Kortum 8c Lerner\u2018s study suggests that venture capital backed patents do not appear to be lower quality patents.

TOWARD A COMPETITIVE PLATFORMS MODEL FOR THE INTERNET AND THE INFORMATION INDUSTRIES The polarizing debates between the commons and proprietary con- trol models threaten to eclipse a third way for the Internet and informa- tion industries to develop: the competitive platforms model. Those en- amored of Schumpeterian thinking often suggest that any attempt to promote access to a proprietary platform is misguided on the ground that any incumbent platform standard ultimately will be displaced entirely. Those commons advocates who maintain that network markets invariably will tip to a single standard tend to argue that all information platform standards must be kept open, lest their owners limit innovation. By incor- porating important insights from both perspectives, the competitive plat- forms model provides a new framework for intellectual property law that reconciles the need to confer the investment incentives necessary to spur innovation with the risk of protecting proprietary dominance.201 This model can also help policymakers appreciate how standard-setting and government funding efforts should work together to develop and main- tain uniform standards where proprietary \ufb01rms would be unable or un- willing to do so.</p> </li> </ol> <p>A.

Rev. 347, 350 (2000) (\u201cDespite wide recognition that socially efficient production of innovation (of all types) requires a comprehensive, complicated \u2018mix' of federal institutions, comparative institutional analysis is lacking, particularly in terms of mixed systems that rely on multiple institutions\u201c).</li> </ol> <p>20]. A basic reason for a more cautious and less intrusive strategy is that, with regard to network markets, \u201cwe are far from having a general theory of when government intervention is preferably to the unregulated market outcome.\" Katz 8:: Shapiro, Systems Competition, supra note 35, at 113.584 COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 1032534 pure\u2014commons.202 As to property law, Carol Rose has explained how the common law recognized that. limited common property\u2014such as easements\u2014in roads and waterways served to enable access to, and thus more ef\ufb01cient exploitation of, the surrounding private property.203 With respect to intellectual property law, the appropriate conception of an in- formation commons is less clearly developed; after all, we are still in the formative stage of developing the basic infrastructure (of hardware and software) for the Internet and the information economy.201 Thus, a criti- cal challenge for policymakers and commentators is to understand what role intellectual property law can play in fostering an information com- mons as the Internet develops.</p> <p>Following the competitive platforms model described below, intellec- tual property rules (and regulation in general) should ensure that parties maintain proprietary control over information platforms to provide the necessary incentives for investment and innovation. Without such invest- ment incentives and opportunities for rewards, the Internet will not con- tinue to develop in a robust fashion. To be sure, preserving the common platform provided by the basic standards of the Internet's logical layer is essential, and intellectual property law should be sensitive to the need to facilitate open access to a standard when it emerges as dominant.205 1f the entire software infrastructure related to the Internet (or other infor- mation platforms) is treated as a commons, however, then there will be only limited opportunities to make money investing in its development. To move back to Professor Rose\u2019s metaphor: Easements serve the impor- tant public purpose of making everyone\u2019s property more valuable, but if property law sought to dedicate all of a property holder\u2019s rights to a com\u2014 mons, the property holder would lose the incentive to develop her property.206 202. Asjulie Cohen put it, \u201cWhat is missing from the conventional economic wisdom about property rights in general and intellectual property rights in particular is a vocabulary for apprehending the link between incomplete control and productivity. between \u2018leaky' entitlements and public welfare, between chaos and creative ferment.\" Julie E.

To be sure, promoting stan- dards competitions risks forestalling, duplicating, and stranding invest- ment,207 but even where a single standard ultimately emerges, the tempo- rary competition is likely to produce a better outcome.208 Moreover, in addition to maintaining the possibility of competition on quality, rival standards also hedge against the risk that the single standard proves \ufb02awed in some fundamean matter.2\u00b09 Finally, even though some plat- form standards will appear to be susceptible to the tipping phenomenon, policymakers and courts will not necessarily be able to predict which mar- kets will tip and which standard will emerge as dominant. Consequently, they should encourage rival platform standards, and only where a single one emerges as dominant, facilitate and\u2014if necessary\u2014mandate access to that standard.</p> </li> <li> <p>Rival Platform Standards. \u2014 In the Internet context in particular and the information industries more generally, standards competitions can often be procompetitive by increasing innovation in a manner that would not occur under cooperative efforts that settle on a lowest com- mon denominator standard. The problem with joint standard-setting ef- forts, such as those led by standard-setting bodies like the IETF, is that they move slowly and need to satisfy a broad range of constituents.210 Indeed, even where the relevant market involves substantial capital ex\u2014 penditures, such as the deployment of cell phone networks, rival stan- dards can facilitate innovation and experimentation. Thus, in evaluating the nature of a network market, rival standards may not only be sustaina- ble, but also procompetitive.

In Europe, regulators concluded that the market for wireless telephones was \u201ctippy\u201d and thus decided to mandate a single standard. In particular, the European Economic Community\u2019s government standard-setting body, European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), adopted the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) as the only standard for which equipment suppliers could provide wireless telephone equip- ment. By contrast, US. regulators (in particular, those at the Federal Communications Commission) decided to let the market determine whether multiple standards could be supported and which one, if any, was clearly superior. As it turned out, this experiment yielded three sepa- rate standards\u2014that is, two alternatives to CSM (Qualcomm\u2019s Code Divi- sion Multiplexing (CDMA) and Time Division Multiplexing (TDMA))\u2014 all of which were deployed in the United States with minimal disruption to consumers.\u201d2 Most notably, the last standard to be deployed, CDMA, uses spectrum more effectively than its predecessors by allowing numer- ous subscribers to use the same channel and providing an easier migra- tion path to next generation uses.\u2018~\"-'\" Consequently, the case of wireless standards highlights the innovative payoff from the FCC\u2019s decision not to mandate a single standard.\u201d4 As the wireless standards example illustrates, rivalry between alterna- tive standards can not only increase innovation, but also lead information 211.

In particular, even though Nintendo had developed a sixteen-bit machine, it did not intro- duce such machines (for fear that it would undercut the sale of its games to its installed base) until Sega began to capture market share with its sixteen-bit machine and games like Sonic?31 More recently, Microsoft in- troduced the Xbox to challenge Sony\u2019s leading console and is seeking to build up a menu of attractive games to lure customers?\u201d As a result of standards competitions such as these, rival information platform sponsors face added incentives to introduce enhanced features, attract new devel- opers for complementary applications, and build up the installed base of users?33 As suggested above in the cellular telephone example, standards competitions often will enable consumers to bene\ufb01t from a more dy- namic product market that includes more choices, enhanced products, and lower prices.

First, to the extent that it seems clear that a company lacks market power, it should be permitted to enforce its intellectual property rights to prevent horizontal access.253 A lack of market power can be shown by recent entry and swings in market share, both of which can demonstrate that the tipping phenomenon has yet to\u2014or will not\u2014kick in. Second, the law needs to recognize the value of allowing competition to proceed in developing platform markets.

In so doing, it not only is calibrating investment incentives (to avoid awarding an unnecessary windfall for innovation), but also is ensuring continued innovation in a market where a single \ufb01rm controls the basic platform standard. This approach, to be sure, raises the question of how to judge whether a \ufb01rm\u2019s incumbent firms may face serious disincentives to exploit intensively [their] intellectual property holdings and sustain signi\ufb01cant levels of fundamental innovation\u201d); id. at 1026 (\u201cIf a large frrrn has a dominant market share and faces few potential entrants, it may be reluctant to undertake or accelerate development projects that may generate radical innovations that could cannibalize the existing profrt stream of current projects\").

The Competitive Platforms Model, the Role of Standard-Setting Bodies, and Government Funding of Research and Development The competitive platforms model provides an alternative guide for Internet policy and intellectual property law to that offered by either the proprietary control or commons theories. In particular, it aims to inte- grate an economic theory about how platform markets develop with the tools offered by intellectual property policy. With respect to the In- ternet\u2019s application layer\u2014be it a Web browser, media player, or other invention that supports the viewing of or access to content\u2014intellectual property law may well prove an effective regulator of access to platform standards and ensure that a firm does not wield monopoly control over a proprietary standard. With respect to the Intemet\u2019s most basic standards contained in its logical layer, however, their public goods quality and open nature mean that they may not be susceptible to proprietary devel- opment.255 To assist in the maintenance and development of such stan- dards, both standard-setting bodies and government support are likely to prove to be the more signi\ufb01cant and effective regulators (as opposed to intellectual property law) in ensuring that the Internet\u2019s logical standards (and ones similar to it) can evolve over time.</li> </ol> <p>Most legal commentators have failed to appreciate the essential role played by standard-setting bodies in developing the rules of the road for the Internet and the information economy. Standard-setting bodies 254. It is important to note in this regard that a company need not control one hundred percent of a market to be considered a monopolist; rather, being a monopolist merely connotes that a company possesses a considerable degree of control over prices and output (or the ability to exclude competitors).

TOWARD A COMPETITIVE PLATFORMS CONCEPTION OF THE LEGALIW OF REVERSE ENGINEERING This Part proposes a new framework for evaluating the legality of reverse engineering efforts based on the competitive platforms model. Under intellectual property law, the permissibility of copying user inter- faces and using reverse engineering to gain access to a platform standard holds great promise as a lever to implement the balance struck by the competitive platforms model. Unlike antitrust or telecommunications regulation, a well-crafted intellectual property regime offers a self-help option by allowing the copying of user interfaces and the use of reverse engineering to gain access to a platform standard to facilitate competi- tion where a \ufb01rm is otherwise likely to dominate that market. Similarly, intellectual property law should resist allowing the copying of a user inter- face or allowing access to a platform standard where competition is other- wise sustainable in that market. Signi\ufb01cantly, intellectual property law, unlike government funding and standard-setting bodies, is not a helpful tool to address the need to support common standards, such as those that comprise the Internet's logical layer. But for inventions at the Internet\u2019s applications layer, intellectual property law will play an important role in regulating the nature of competition and facilitating innovation.</p> </li> </ol> <p>As discussed below, the current state of intellectual property law fails to implement any coherent competition policy, let alone the approach suggested by the competitive platforms model. To highlight the recom- mended change in direction, sections A and B examine two in\ufb02uential 277.

The Challenge of Converging Platforms and Connectix As discussed brie\ufb02y in Part I, Connectix represented the \ufb01rst major case to raise a horizontal access claim. In that case, Connectix used re- verse engineering, including some intermediate copying of Sony\u2019s PlayS- tation video game console\u2019s BIOS (basic input-output system), to develop a new software program called the \u201cVirtual Game Station\u201d or \u201cVGS.\u201d This new platform enabled consumers to use Connectix\u2019s product to play on their computers games made for Sony\u2019s PlayStation.283 The Ninth Circuit analyzed Sony\u2019s challenge to Connectix\u2019s use of its copyrighted product under the fair use standard set forth in its earlier decision, Sega Enterprises Ltd. v. Accolade, Inc.284 In Sega, the court held that intermediate copying of a program to gain access to its functional elements\u2014as part of a reverse engineering process\u2014constitutes a fair use under copyright when such use is \u201cnecessary\u201d to gain access to the func- tional elements of the copyright itself.285 Although Sega did not expressly distinguish between horizontal and vertical access, it did recognize a criti- cal distinction between the two in asking whether the alleged infringer\u2019s product would satisfy demand for the protected work.286 Moreover, the Supreme Court\u2019s subsequent decision in Campbell 1).

See 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112 (2000). With respect to software patents, however, neither caselaw nor the Patent and Trademark Office regulations requires the disclosure of the actual source code. See N.

In particular, the court should have looked more closely at whether the markets for video games and computing were in fact converging, such that VGS\u2019s product would compete with Sony's.29\" Because there are important signs that this was the case (as recognized in the district court\u2019s opinion, for example29'), the next question would be (2000); Stewart v.

Given Microsoft\u2019s recent entry into this market, and the continued strength of Nintendo, it seems that no such access is necessary,292 and thus Connec- tix\u2019s copying should not have been judged a fair use. Finally, if Connectix had engaged in the reverse engineering of a dominant standard, it should also have been required to show that it did not merely clone Sony\u2019s product, but added some value to it. The Ninth Circuit may have had this criteria in mind when it determined that Connectix's product was \u201cmodestly transformative,\u201d but this conclusory language should not substitute for the relevant market analysis.</p> </li> </ol> <p>The Connectix precedent threatens to allow horizontal access in con- texts where so doing will undermine important investment incentives. In particular, VGS\u2019s use of Sony\u2019s innovation without permission\u2014by creat- ing a product that relied on the established brand strength and set of complements\u2014enabled it to appropriate the bene\ufb01ts of Sony\u2019s invest- ments in a competitive market that will limit Sony\u2019s return on them.\u201c\u201993 If this precedent is followed and upheld, intellectual property law will not protect companies whose nondominant innovations are copied and re- sold in a related form that avoids signi\ufb01cant research and development, marketing, and other key investments. To be sure, it is important that courts do not simply take a company\u2019s opposition to reverse engineering as suf\ufb01cient to condemn an alleged use as infringing,294 but the Connectix court did not even begin to formulate an analysis that evaluated the rele- vant incentives created by its decision.295 1022, 1027 (9th Cir. 2000) (\ufb01nding it \u201cmanifestly clear\u201d that an emulator competed directly with the Sony PlayStation console).</p> <ol> <li> <p>See Marriott, supra note 236, at G1 (reporting on the active rivalry among Microsoft, Nintendo, and Sony); Savitz. supra note 236, at 30 (same).</p> </li> <li> <p>The costs of developing a platform standard often are substantial. 1n Sony's case, it spent over $600 million developing the PlayStation.

Cf. Bloom, 214 F.3d at 1027 (noting that emulator sales spur more sales for the games).

A Model for Horizontal Access Regulation: Lotus v. Borland In perhaps the most famous case addressing the horizontal access issue, the First Circuit held that Borland could incorporate Lotus 1-2-3\u20195 command hierarchy to build a rival spreadsheet program (its Quattro program).296 In that case, Lotus argued that to allow competition within the standard it developed by not protecting the user interface threatened to make its invention\u2014and the community of users trained on the inter- face\u2014a \u201ccommon resource\u201d in which no particular company would want to invest.297 Borland countered that it could not compete without access to Lotus\u2019s user interface, as many users already had adopted it. Unfortu- nately, no clear opinion emerged in this case, in which the districtjudge and the two court of appeals judges to hear the case all took different approaches (and the Supreme Court divided equally).298 In Lotus, Borland argued that Lotus\u2019s established standard needed to be shared through some form of an open access arrangement.299 In rul- ing for Borland and providing it with open access to Lotus\u2019s user inter- face, the majority focused on whether the would-be protected resource constituted \u201ca method of operation\"\u2014like the buttons on a VCR\u2014that warranted no protection under copyright law.~\u201c\"0 By contrast, judge Boudin\u2019s concurrence called for a more \ufb02exible inquiry and a competi- tion policy focus.

Similarly, the particularized protection for reverse engineering allowed in the SCPA also requires that any reverse engineering of protected works he used to provide an improved\u2014and not merely an imitated\u2014competitive product. See 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 906(a) (2000); see also Raskind 8c Stern, supra note 67, at 266 (noting that the Act\u2019s reverse engineering provision \u201cstrikes a balance between the exclusive reproduction right of an owner and the public interest in innovation, by imposing the condition on the copyist that an improved, or at least original, chip product must result\"). Signi\ufb01cantly, this requirement should not be the sole criteria for allowing reverse engineering because, as demonstrated by Connectix, it is often quite simple to make modest improvements and use those as a su\ufb01icient basis to free ride on a much more substantial investment.

In the applications layer, as well as in some possible logical layer developments, there is going to be an increasing number of rival inventions that will battle it out for supremacy. The recent browser war between Microsoft and Netscape and the current tussles between rival media players provide some hints of what sorts of competitive struggles lie ahead. To ensure that marketplace battles like these bene\ufb01t consum- ers, it is important that intellectual property law develop a clear and effec- tive vision for when and how proprietary rights in software will be pro- tected. The competitive platforms model, as outlined in Part IV and applied above, would do just that.</p> <p>C. Possible Objections to a Competitive Platforms-Based Approach to Reverse Engineering Given the continuing debate over the proper legal treatment of re- verse engineering, it should not be surprising that there are numerous countervailing arguments against revising it to follow the competitive platforms model. In particular, there are three related criticisms that can be made against this approach: the difficulty of distinguishing between vertical and horizontal access, the administrative costs in implementing this model, and the challenge of discerning at what point in a standard's development a rival firm should be permitted access. This section ad- dresses each concern in turn.</p> <p>Despite the fair use doctrine's inquiry into whether a product is sub- stitutive or transformative, courts have resisted focusing on whether ac- cess to a proprietary standard is sought by a horizontal competitor or a vertical complementor. Although one response is to criticize courts for failing to analyze the actual market effects?\u201d another might be to evalu- ate whether this distinction is too elusive to guide intellectual property policy. In support of this point, one might highlight how platform own- ers often choose a \u201crazor and blades\u201d strategy whereby they do not choose to appropriate fully the value of the platform via direct sales, but instead 315. Such products would include those involving claims of vertical compatibility where a party sought to develop games for an information platform. See, e.g., Sega Enters. Ltd. v. Accolade. lnc., 977 F.2d 1510, 1514 (9th Cir. 1992) (granting manufacturer of games access to game console); Lewis Galoob Toys, Inc. v. Nintendo of Am., Inc.. 780 F. Supp. 1283, 1286 (N.D.

First, as to this basic criticism, it is important to highlight that the right to the self-help remedy of reverse engineering is a less desirable mode of access than a license, so there still are considerable incentives for parties to strike a deal. The costliness of reverse engineering, the considerable value of the technical support that the inventor can provide, and the potential trademark issues that may impede the marketing of a product that is not of\ufb01cially approved are among the factors that might drive parties to the negotiating table.318 Moreover, it is important that intellectual property law set as the default principle that complementors should be afforded such access because in most cases it will be to the advantage of the platform owners\u2014and the public more generally\u2014to enable such access and opportunity for improvement.319 A related criticism regarding the vertical-horizontal distinction is that some products could elude easy classi\ufb01cation. In particular, a \u201cmid- dleware\u201d product that emerges as a complementary one, but ultimately substitutes for the platform itself, might not easily fall into either cate- gory. (The classic example of middleware is the Web browser, which could be used in combination with Microsoft\u2019s operating system, but also threatened\u2014over the long terrn\u2014to supplant it.) In such cases, the out- come will depend on whether the product can be used with the plat- form\u2014as, say, a browser is used with an operating system\u2014or actually would be used instead of the product, but might not provide as optimal performance\u2014as, say, the virtual game station product.</p> <p>A second potential criticism of the competitive platforms model is that a standards-based approach would add additional administrative costs and uncertainty into the current legal environment. These costs would include not only the court costs of judging whether a particular 317. Indeed, this business model is now standard in the video game industry. See Samuelson 8c Scotchmer, supra note 39, at 1618\u201419 (\u201cIn the game system market, platform developers typically lose money on sales of consoles, making up losses on sales of games and peripherals\"); Gaither, supra note 217, at C17 (\u201cWhile pro\ufb01ts are thin as manufactures subsidize the sale of hardware, they grow rapidly once consumers start buying games to play on them.\u201d).</p> <ol> <li> <p>For a discussion of the costs, see johnson-Laird, supra note 39, at 900-01. On the trademark point, competitors are allowed to represent that a product is compatible with an information platform, but they do not gain the bene\ufb01ts of being approved or certi\ufb01ed by the platform owner. See Mark A. Lemley 8: David McGowan, Could java Change Everything? The Competitive Propriety of a Proprietary Standard, 43 Antitrust Bull. 715, 761\u201464 (1998).</p> </li> <li> <p>See Katz, supra note 46, at 334\u201435 (outlining default rule rationale for vertical access).610 COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW [VoL 103:534 platform standard has established su\ufb02icient dominance to lose intellec- tual property protection against reverse engineering, but also the costs in the marketplace of license agreements that would be forestalled by the legal uncertainty of a standards-based approach. As an initial matter, this argument mistakenly assumes that the status quo provides for a clear rule on the legality of reverse engineering and the protectibility of platform standards and user interfaces.320 Consequently, if the competitive plat- forms model strikes the right balance, it may well lead to greater certainty than a bad rule that generates undesirable outcomes and begs for excep- tions.-\"\u201821 In terms of the costs on the legal system of implementing a stan- dards-based approach, the second response is to point to how antitrust law\u2014both as administered by the courts and by legal counseling\u2014suc- cessfully uses a similar rule-of-reason-type approach,322 as does copyright law in implementing the idea-expression dichotomy that separates pro- tected from unprotected works.323 Not only does a standards-based ap- proach allow for important precision in this area, but its unde\ufb01ned na- ture also can encourage parties to settle access disputes out of court on mutually agreeable terms?\u00a324 Moreover, as the analogy to antitrust law suggests, lawyers and business persons will increasingly grow pro\ufb01cient in anticipating the likely outcome and will act accordingly.</p> </li> </ol> <p>The \ufb01nal question presents the greatest challenge to the workability and soundness of the approach outlined herein: How will courts know when a standard is suf\ufb01ciently well established to allow access through reverse engineering? As an initial matter, it is critical to remember the two alternatives: allowing access in all cases, or never allowing access. Given the \ufb02aws of each alternative, the risks of a limited right of access would have to be quite great to warrant rejection in favor of either alter- native approach. To be sure, there is not an obvious marketplace test of 320. See Rothman, supra note 289, at 1 (describing reverse engineering issue as an \u201cintractable problem\u201d for intellectual property law); supra Part 11.A.1 (discussing lack of clarity in legal treatment of reverse engineering).</p> <ol> <li> <p>The mles-versus\u2014standards debate is well developed, with most commentators acknowledging the usefulness of both and concluding that the desirability of either approach depends on the situation.

First, it is signi\ufb01cant that courts evaluating antitrust cases regularly\u2014and, for the most part, successfully\u2014undertake this analysis. Second, by employ- ing such an analysis to guide the scope of intellectual property rights, courts can enable self-help and private conduct to address market domi- nance issues before they emerge as a monopolization issue. In the case of RealNetworks\u2019s use of reverse engineering to compete against Microsoft, for example, RealNetworks is taking a proactive step that is unavailable to an antitrust court, which generally must wait to mandate an access ar- rangement until after a company establishes a monopolization case against a competitor. As many commentators have highlighted with re- spect to the browser war between Microsoft and Netscape, the possibility of judicially overseen relief came too late to help Netscape.325 But for cases where reverse engineering of a platform standard or copying of a user interface can forestall or avoid monopolization, permitting this con- duct can potentially avoid the need for antitrust action.</p> <p>The goal of the limited access right envisioned by the competitive platforms model and a reformed legal treatment of reverse engineering is to facilitate a procompetitive environment. Under this regime, parties would be free to gain access through reverse engineering at any point, but if they guessed wrong about whether an information platform consti- tuted a dominant standard, they would potentially be liable for infringe- ment. At present, the potential for guessing incorrectly is much greater than it would be under the competitive platforms model, as there is no clear guide for the scope and application of the fair use and misuse prin- ciples in such cases. To be sure, a clear rule always allowing access or never allowing it would eliminate such guesswork, but it would potentially undermine investment incentives or the ability to limit the market domi- nance of a particular product.</p> <p>For close cases, the remedial consequences for any infringement would depend upon the circumstances surrounding the infringement. In some cases, where the appropriateness of access is a close call, courts might choose to provide for a liability-type remedy where the defendant would be allowed continued access based upon some licensing fee.326 In 325. See Timothy F. Bresnahan, A Remedy that Falls Short of Restoring Competition, Antitrust, Fall 2001, at 67, 71 n.10 (noting that the threat presented to Microsoft by the Web browser no longer exists); Charles A. James, The Real Microsoft Case and Settlement, Antitrust, Fall 2001, at 58, 61 (\u201c[B]y most accounts, Microsoft has essentially won the browser war; relief to revive Netscape Navigator as a middleware threat may have been too little, too late.\").</p> <ol> <li>See Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., 510 U.S. 569, 578 n.10 (1994) (suggesting that injunctive relief may not be appropriate in close cases where a defendant612 COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 103:534 other cases, where there is a number of alternative viable standards\u2014as is the case in cell phone standards327 and video game consoles\u2014there may well be marketplace analogs of licensing systems that could be imposed by the courts, along with any other remedies that would be appropriate to impose on a party who infringed a standard holder's intellectual prop- erty. With respect to Internet applications, there is likely to be a number of rival applications to perform a particular function because the open logical standard invites entry. As the case of media players illustrates, there often will be a number of entrants that will seek to develop a suc- cessful information platforrn.32\u201c CONCLUSION Intellectual property law's unresolved search for a sensible regime to regulate computer software and the Internet re\ufb02ects a fundamental de- bate over what framework will best facilitate innovation in the informa\u2014 tion industries. Given the dif\ufb01culty of resolving the commons versus pro- prietary control debate, the increasing complexity of and uncertainty in this area is quite understandable. But intellectual property law\u2019s continu- ing failure to produce any clear framework for determining when infor- mation platform inventors can maintain proprietary control of their in- ventions undermines its ability to advance a coherent competition policy strategy.</li> </ol> <p>Courts and policymakers, rather than adopting either the commons or proprietary control perspective, should embrace the approach sug- gested by the competitive platforms model. This model envisions that intellectual property policy can regulate open access to information plat- forms in advance of and in a manner consistent with antitrust law. In particular, intellectual property law, in regulating the permissibility of re- verse engineering, possesses the tools to facilitate access to platform stan- dards and user interfaces only where so doing will thwart the likely domi- nance of a single \ufb01rm\u2014before antitrust or regulatory oversight would need to step in to facilitate entry.</p> <p>exceeds the bounds of its fair use rights). The classic framework for evaluating the appropriate choice of remedies is, of course, the one set forth in Guido Calabresi 8c A. Douglas Melamed. Property Rules, Liability Rules, and Inalienability: One View of the Cathedral, 85 Harv. L. Rev. 1089, 1106\u201410 (1972). In general, Congress leaves it to the courts to develop the appropriate remedy for intellectual property violation, but, on occasion. it has imposed a particular regime. See, e.g., 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 136a\u00a9(l)(F) (2000) (setting forth binding arbitration procedures for competing pesticide registration claims).</p> <ol> <li> <p>To be sure, the FCC (and not a court) decided whether to mandate compatibility to a common protocol in the cell phone context. See supra note 212 and accompanying text. But such questions could easily be presented to courts and presumably will be with increasing frequency. Cf. Secure Servs. Tech., Inc. v. Time and Space Processing, Inc., 722 F. Supp. 1354. 1359\u201463 (ED. Va. 1989) (examining intellectual property issues raised by reverse engineering of a protocol for enhanced facsimile machines to establish horizontal compatibility).</p> </li> <li> <p>See supra notes 56\u201458 and accompanying text.2003] INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY POLICY 613 The competitive platforms model also recognizes how intellectual property policy in general and Internet policy in particular calls for the federal government and standard-setting bodies to play an important role in supporting and coordinating the development of the common infor- mation technology standards that would not be developed by any proprie- tary \ufb01rm. With respect to the Internet, the open standards that comprise its logical layer, for example, require government funding and the coor- dination of standard setting bodies to evolve in an effective fashion. Put simply, even with intellectual property protection, these standards are ap- propriately treated as a commons because they are not likely to be devel- oped or maintained by a proprietary \ufb01rm. But if the Intemet\u2019s entire software infrastructure, including rival applications, is treated as a com- mons, individual \ufb01rms will not invest in developing and extending its po- tential. Thus, an optimal Internet policy requires that both courts\u2014in developing judicial doctrine\u2014and policymakers\u2014in supporting the com- mon and open Internet infrastructure\u2014reject the attractive simplicity of the commons and proprietary control perspectives and embrace the bal- ance and nuance of the competitive platforms model.Copyright\u00a9 2003 EBSCO Publishing</p> </li> </ol> <p></p>"},{"location":"History/Research%20Project/Source%20Documents/Tim%20Berners-Lee%20Wikipedia/","title":"Tim Berners Lee Wikipedia","text":"<p>-tx- |  Sir</p> <p>Tim Berners-Lee</p> <p>OM KBE FRS FREng FRSA DFBCS RDI</p> <p>Berners-Lee in 2014</p> <p>| | Born | </p> <p>Timothy John Berners-Lee</p> <p>8 June 1955 (age\u00a067)  </p> <p>London, England</p> <p>| | Other\u00a0names | TimBL TBL | | Education | The Queen's College, Oxford (BA) | | Known\u00a0for | Invention of the World Wide Web | | Spouse(s) | </p> <p>Nancy Carlson</p> <p>(m.\u00a01990; div.\u00a02011)</p> <p>Rosemary Leith</p> <p>(m.\u00a02014)</p> <p>| | Children | 2 children; 3 step-children | | Parent(s) | Conway Berners-Lee Mary Lee Woods | | Awards | Turing Award (2016) Queen Elizabeth Prize (2013) Foreign Associate of the National Academy of Sciences (2009) Order of Merit (2007) ACM Software System Award (1995) | |  | | Scientific career | | Institutions | CERN Massachusetts Institute of Technology World Wide Web Consortium University of Oxford University of Southampton | | Website | w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/ |</p> <p>Sir Timothy John Berners-Lee, OM, KBE, FRS, FREng, FRSA, DFBCS, RDI (born 8 June 1955),[1] also known as TimBL, is an English computer scientist best known as the inventor of the World Wide Web.

Sanford that the enslaved Scott\u2019s four-year residence in the free north was not sufficient to make him a free man. In his majority opinion, Chief Justice Roger B Taney cited two main rationales for the ruling against Scott; first, as an African American, Scott \u201chad no rights which the white man was bound to respect\u201d(2.6.8) and was therefore not eligible to bring a suit to court. Second, enslaved people were property, the same as any other. By prohibiting slavery north of the 36\u201930\u201d line, the Missouri compromise of 1820 violated citizens\u2019 constitutional rights against unwarranted seizure of property. Taney's decision effectively made it impossible to prevent the spread of slavery, even in states that had outlawed it decades prior. Many legal historians consider the Dred Scott decision the worst decision ever made by the supreme court; it was overturned by the passage of the 13th and 14th amendments to the constitution in 1865 and 1868, respectively.</p> <p>A success of American democracy was in the way an enslaved American could contest a fair trial in the supreme court.

However, it also failed through extreme racism, political violence,\u00a0 and unjust legislation. In 1857, the supreme court ruled Dred Scott v. Sanford that the enslaved Scott's four-year residence in the free north was insufficient to make him a free man. Even though Dred Scott was a resident of the north, to take away the property of an enslaver would be unconstitutional. This was a success of the right to free trial because Dred Scott could prosecute his owner for infringing his rights. On the other hand, American Democracy failed through the evident lack of regard for the constitution. The Dred Scott decision allowed slavery to exist in northern states that had outlawed it decades prior. The ruling stated that\"\u00a0 \"had no rights which the white man was bound to respect\" (2.6.8). Bleeding Kansas was a failure of the right to vote; for the first time in American history, the government allowed the state to choose its status as either a slave state or a free state. Due to this decision, abolitionists and enslavers flocked to Kansas to sway the state's election. Having these polar groups in such proximity caused a massive amount of political violence between the groups. The tensions would continue to rise into the 1940s, and in 1950, America acquired California. This time, instead of declaring that California's inhabitants would decide the state's status, the senate compromised and created the fugitive slave law. This was a success for American Democracy as a compromise came about through deliberation rather than violence during a time of extremely high tensions between the northern and southern states. The terms of the compromise, specifically the fugitive slave law, were a failure of American Democracy. The Fugitive Slave Law enabled enslavers to recapture escaped enslaved people in the north. The law itself was problematic due to the liminal oversight through the judicial system. The judge would almost always rule in favor of the slave hunter rather than the enslaved person, making the system heavily flawed. Many \"slave hunters\" in the north would falsely prosecute free blacks in northern states and kidnap them into forced labor in the south. The unjust legislation of the Fugitive Slave Act, as well as the failure to moderate the practices of the American people, was a failure of American Democracy's right to life, liberty, and property. By taking away the rights of free blacks who were not escaped enslaved people, the law itself was unconstitutional and went against the ideals of the American school of thought that the founding fathers had in mind. We can see how America's political and social environment before the Civil War was incredibly complicated through all of these successes and failures. Each event encompasses either a success or failure of American democracy, showing that in a growing country, the ability to remain constitutional and in favor of American democracy was difficult to achieve.</p>"},{"location":"History/Unit%202/README-Unit%202/","title":"README Unit 2","text":"<p>%% Zoottelkeeper: Beginning of the autogenerated index file list  %% - \ud83d\udcc4 Final Writing Assignment %% Zoottelkeeper: End of the autogenerated index file list  %%</p>"},{"location":"History/Unit%203/Cold%20War%20prompt/","title":"Cold War prompt","text":"<p>answer the following prompt in a 5-7 sentence paragraph:  </p> <p>How was the Cold War waged in practice?

Reconstruction and Redemption were two important periods in American history that took place during and after the Civil War, respectively. During Reconstruction, which lasted from 1865 to 1877, the federal government implemented a series of policies aimed at rebuilding the Southern states and ensuring the rights of newly freed African Americans. These policies included the passage of the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments to the Constitution, which abolished slavery, granted citizenship to all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and granted the right to vote to African American men, respectively. Redemption, on the other hand, was a period of time during which Southern states sought to reverse the gains made by African Americans during Reconstruction. This period, which lasted from roughly 1877 to 1900, saw the rise of Jim Crow laws and other forms of racial segregation, as well as the growth of lynching and other forms of racial violence. It was during this time that the Ku Klux Klan, a white supremacist organization, emerged and gained a significant following in the South. The Gilded Age, which took place from roughly 1880 to 1900, was a period of rapid economic growth and industrialization in the United States. It was also a time when the labor of different racial groups was exploited in similar and different ways. African Americans, for example, were largely confined to low-paying agricultural and domestic work, and were often subject to discrimination and violence. At the same time, many European immigrants, particularly those from Eastern and Southern Europe, were also working in low-paying, dangerous jobs in the industrial sector. The Gilded Age was a period of rapid economic growth in the United States, marked by the rise of large corporations and financial institutions. This period followed the Reconstruction era, during which the government sought to rebuild the country after the Civil War and ensure the rights of newly-freed African American slaves. The Reconstruction era saw the passage of important legislation, such as the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and the 14th Amendment, which granted citizenship and equal protection under the law to African Americans. However, despite these efforts, African Americans continued to face significant discrimination and oppression during the Gilded Age. Many were forced to work as sharecroppers on cotton plantations, often in conditions that were little better than slavery(3.3.5). Meanwhile, other racial and ethnic groups, such as Chinese immigrants, were also subject to exploitation and discrimination. In particular, Chinese immigrants were often forced to work on dangerous railroad construction projects and mining operations, where they were paid low wages and faced harsh working conditions. Overall, the Gilded Age was a period of great inequality and exploitation, with different racial and ethnic groups facing similar forms of oppression in the pursuit of profit. While the Reconstruction era had sought to address the legacy of slavery and ensure the rights of African Americans, these efforts were largely undone during the Gilded Age as the country's focus shifted towards industrialization and economic growth.</p>"},{"location":"History/Unit%203/Part%202%20-%20Historical%20Analysis/#bullet-points","title":"Bullet Points:","text":"<ul> <li>The Gilded Age was a period of rapid economic growth in the US, marked by the rise of large corporations and financial institutions(3.4.1, 3.4.4)</li> <li>The Gilded Age followed the Reconstruction era, during which the government sought to rebuild the country after the Civil War and ensure the rights of newly-freed African American slaves(3.2.2)</li> <li>The Reconstruction era saw the passage of important legislation, such as the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and the 14th Amendment(3.2.1)</li> <li>Despite these efforts, African Americans continued to face significant discrimination and oppression during the Gilded Age</li> <li>Many African Americans were forced to work as sharecroppers on cotton plantations, often in conditions that were little better than slavery(3.3.5)</li> <li>Other racial and ethnic groups, such as Chinese immigrants, were also subject to exploitation and discrimination(3.5.1. 3.5.2)</li> <li>Chinese immigrants were often forced to work on dangerous railroad construction projects and mining operations, where they were paid low wages and faced harsh working conditions(3.5.2)</li> <li>The Gilded Age was a period of great inequality and exploitation, with different racial and ethnic groups facing similar forms of oppression in the pursuit of profit</li> <li>The focus of the country shifted towards industrialization and economic growth, undoing much of the progress made during the Reconstruction era.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"History/Unit%203/Part%203%20-%20Historical%20Reflection/","title":"Part 3   Historical Reflection","text":""},{"location":"History/Unit%203/Part%203%20-%20Historical%20Reflection/#paragraph","title":"Paragraph","text":"<p>From my historical understanding of the Reconstruction and Redemption periods, I believe that the circumstances that move our country closer to its founding ideals are those that promote equality, justice, and inclusivity.

Joseph has no choice but to leave, other than face death. This makes the holy family refugees.</p> </li> <li> <p>Personal Reflection: What is challenging/enlightening/thought-provoking about the article for you? Explain. (No right answer here, as long as you show you are thoughtfully considering the implications of the article and giving sound reasoning for your opinions)  </p> <p>The angel literally tells joseph to \"flee\" to Egypt, almost literally calling them refugees. </p> </li> </ol> <p>Listen to Carlos\u2019 Story: This father and son pair came to the Kino Border Initiative in Nogales, MX which is a Catholic non-profit seeking to provide accompaniment and advocacy for migrants.\u00a0</p> <ol> <li> <p>What from the story stands out to you and why?  </p> <p>It stands out that Carlos needed to leave to get the education he desired. His family decided to help him leave, and they struggled through the whole journey to get all the way to the United States.</p> </li> <li> <p>Reflecting on Scripture through the lens of the migrant: How does this family\u2019s story humanize and illuminate the experience of the Holy Family fleeing to Egypt in Matthew\u2019s Gospel? In other words, what does it make you consider or wonder about what Mary, Joseph, and Jesus\u2019 experienced?  </p> <p>The holy family probably also suffered through poor weather, officials, and other struggles through the flight to Egypt, it makes me wonder why they would decide to leave if they had to struggle so much. </p> </li> <li> <p>Reflecting on the experience of migrants through the lens of the Gospel: How might the Gospel story and the claim that Christ is in the refugee be good news to migrants like the father and son from El Salvador? What difference could it make for them to claim that truth?  </p> <p>Joseph had to let go of his life back in Nazareth, and make sure that he could keep his family safe. Just like the refugee, Christ was forced to flee his home in the face of danger. The gospel of luke shows how Christ is in the refugee. In doing so, it brings hope to refugees that claim that Christ is within them and has suffered their same struggles, it helps them feel less alone in their suffering.</p> </li> <li> <p>If the \u201cFlight to Egypt\u201d shows that God/Christ is present in the migrant/refugee, what might these stories (the Gospel story and the Salvadoran family\u2019s story) call forth from people who call themselves Christian? What would it look like to \u201clive as though this truth were true\u201d and what are the challenges of living that out? (This could be purely academic reasoning if you are not Christian, or you could make it personal if you are Christian).</p> <p>The \"Flight to Egypt\" story in the Gospel can be seen as a metaphor for the plight of migrants and refugees, and suggests that God is present in and cares for these individuals. This story can call forth a sense of empathy and compassion from Christians, and inspire them to take action to support and advocate for migrants and refugees. Living out this truth would involve treating migrants and refugees with dignity and respect, and actively working to address the systemic issues that lead to forced migration. This could include supporting organizations that provide aid and assistance to migrants and refugees, advocating for policies that protect their rights, and actively challenging discrimination and prejudice against them. Challenges of living this out include the complexity of the issues surrounding migration and the tendency for societies to demonize and stigmatize migrants and refugees. Additionally, it can be difficult to reconcile the actions of one's own government with the call to care for migrants and refugees.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"Religion/Christian%20Scripture/January/Jesus%20the%20refugee/CW%20World%20of%20Jesus/","title":"The World of Jesus","text":"<p>Step 1: Work with your group members (A, B, C, D, E) to respond to the questions for your section based on your textbook reading.

(CNS photo/Hannah McKay, Reuters)\u00a0</p> <p>With refugees and migrants in the news, some commentators have sought to draw parallels between their plight and that of the Holy Family\u2014Jesus, Mary and Joseph. How accurate are these comparisons? Were Jesus, Mary and Joseph what we would consider today \u201crefugees\u201d?</p> <p>Yes.</p> <p>In the second chapter of the Gospel of Matthew, we read the story of the \u201cFlight into Egypt\u201d in which, after the birth of Jesus and the visit from the Magi, an \u201cangel of the Lord\u201d comes to Joseph in a dream and warns him to leave Bethlehem for Egypt (Mt 2:12-15). Why? Because King Herod was planning to \u201cseek out the child to destroy him.\u201d Mary and Joseph do leave, along with Jesus, and, according to Matthew, make their way into Egypt. Afterward, King Herod slaughters all the male children in Bethlehem under two years of age. This dramatic episode is part of the Gospel reading for the \u201cFeast of the Holy Innocents,\u201d celebrated on Dec. 28.</p> <p>A family is forced to flee their homeland for fear of persecution. This is the classic modern-day definition of a refugee.</p> <p>So, according to the Gospel of Matthew, what is going on? A family is forced to flee their homeland for fear of persecution. This is the classic modern-day definition of a refugee. In fact, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees defines that group of people as follows:</p> <p>A refugee is someone who has been forced to flee his or her country because of persecution, war, or violence. A refugee has a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group.</p> <p>The Holy Family, as Matthew recounts the story, was fleeing because of a \u201cwell-founded fear of persecution\u201d because of their \u201cmembership in a particular social group,\u201d in this case people with young children living in Bethlehem. I am not sure how you could get any clearer than that.</p> <p>The Holy Family, as Matthew recounts the story, was fleeing because of a \u201cwell-founded fear of persecution.\u201d</p> <p>Did Joseph and Mary apply for official refugee status? Of course not. Those kinds of regulations were most likely not in effect. There may not have even been any borders at the time. But, as Daniel J. Harrington, S.J., a New Testament scholar, reminds us in his commentary on Matthew in the Sacra Pagina series:</p> <p>Egypt, which came under Roman control in 30 B.C., was outside the jurisdiction of Herod. Egypt had been the traditional place of refuge for Jews both in biblical times (see 1 Kgs 11:40; Jer 26:21) and in the Maccabean era when the high priest Onias IV fled there [emphasis mine].</p> <p>Thus, we see a family fleeing to a foreign country out of fear of persecution.</p> <p>Even the language used in Matthew illuminates their situation. As in all things with the New Testament, it\u2019s helpful to turn to the original Greek. Matthew, writing for a Jewish-Christian audience around AD 85, presents the angel\u2019s command as follows:</p> <p>\u1f18\u03b3\u03b5\u03c1\u03b8\u03b5\u1f76\u03c2 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac\u03bb\u03b1\u03b2\u03b5 \u03c4\u1f78 \u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03b4\u03af\u03bf\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c4\u1f74\u03bd \u03bc\u03b7\u03c4\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1 \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c6\u03b5\u1fe6\u03b3\u03b5 \u03b5\u1f30\u03c2 \u0391\u1f34\u03b3\u03c5\u03c0\u03c4o\u03bd....</p> <p>Transliterated, that is Egertheis paralabe to paidion kai t\u0113n m\u0113tera autou kai pheuge eis Aigypton....</p> <p>Or, \u201cArise, and take the child and his mother, and flee into Egypt....\u201d (Mt 2:13).</p> <p>Even Matthew\u2019s angel identifies the Holy Family as refugees.</p> <p>The word to focus on is pheuge, \u201cflee,\u201d from which derives the word \u201crefugee,\u201d the one who flees. Even Matthew\u2019s angel identifies the Holy Family as refugees.</p> <p>But even if the Holy Family does not fit the contemporary definition of refugees (and they do) and even if the Gospel of Matthew did not use the Greek word pheuge (and it does), we should still have compassion and be ready to care for modern-day refugees and migrants.</p> <p>Why? Because Jesus asks us to. Later in Matthew\u2019s Gospel, Jesus reminds us that any time we \u201cwelcome the stranger\u201d we welcome Jesus himself (Mt 25). Refugees and migrants are our brothers and sisters desperately in need of our help. Jesus\u2019 command to care for the stranger is also, for the Christian, a law superseding any laws that would hinder, prevent or outlaw such care and compassion. I am always amazed that some Christians who appeal to higher laws in other life issues set them aside when it comes to refugees and migrants.</p> <p>From 1992 to 1994, I worked with the Jesuit Refugee Service in Nairobi, Kenya, where I came to know hundreds of refugees who had fled from Sudan, Uganda, Somalia, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Rwanda, Burundi, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and many other countries out of a \u201cwell-founded fear of persecution.\u201d Some, as the Holy Family had feared, had seen their children murdered in front of them. Others had watched as their parents were slaughtered before them. Despite their intense and almost unimaginable suffering, they were among the most faithful people I have ever met\u2014holy families in their own ways.</p> <p>Surely these families deserve our protection as much as the Holy Family did.</p> <p></p> <p>James Martin, S.J.</p> <p>The Rev.

Always initiated from YHWH\u2019s side toward human beings, and humans gradually learn to trust it and respond in kind. How have covenants been created, sealed, honored and/or broken?

How does a particular story fit into the whole story of salvation or God\u2019s love for us? What do each of these stories reveal about God\u2019s love and God\u2019s desires for human beings?</p> <p>Gen 15:1-7 - Covenant with Abraham</p> <p>Gen 17:1-14 - Covenant of Circumcision</p> <p>Gen 25:19-34 - Birth of Esau and Jacob</p> <p>Ex 3:1-4:9 - Call and Commission of Moses</p> <p>Ex 20:1-17 - Ten Commandments</p> <p>Deut 6:4-9 The Great Commandment/Shema</p> <p>Josh 1:1-11 - God helps Joshua</p> <p>Judges 2:1-3:6 Sin Cycle, Israel's Infidelities</p> <p>Judges 4 - Deborah and Barak</p> <p>1 Samuel 1 - Hannah\u2019s Prayer</p> <p>1 Samuel 3 - Call of Samuel</p> <p>1 Sam 8:10-18 - Governance of a King</p> <p>1 Sam 16:1-13 - Samuel Anoints David</p> <p>2 Sam 7:1-17 - Davidic Covenant</p> <p>1 Kgs 11:1-13 - Solomon\u2019s Disobedience  </p> <p>Faith: Faith is first and foremost a gift.

How do people/groups respond or fail to respond to that invitation? What can we learn about living a life of faith today?</p> <p>Gen 12:1-9 - The Call of Abraham</p> <p>Gen 17:1-14 - Covenant of Circumcision</p> <p>Gen 22:1-19 - Testing of Abraham</p> <p>Ex 3:1-4:9 - Call and Commission of Moses</p> <p>Exodus 32:1-29 - The Golden Calf</p> <p>Ex 33:7-23 - Moses\u2019 Intimacy with God</p> <p>Deut 6:4-9 The Great Commandment/Shema</p> <p>Deut 30:15-20 - The Choice before Israel</p> <p>Josh 1:1-11 - God helps Joshua</p> <p>1 Samuel 1 - Hannah\u2019s Prayer</p> <p>1 Samuel 3 - Call of Samuel</p> <p>1 Sam 16:1-13 - Samuel Anoints David</p> <p>2 Samuel 11 - David\u2019s Sin</p> <p>2 Samuel 12 - David\u2019s Repentance</p> <p>Sin and Forgiveness/Atonement: Human beings freely choose to act sinfully, harming their relationships with each other and God.\u00a0 Doing so, human beings must live with the \u201cnatural\u201d or \u201clogical\u201d consequences of their actions.

The song repeatedly says \"my love is gone\" - symbolizing that the Israelites have lost their love for god. But at the end of the song, it switches to the song thank you, where the tone switches to a much more hopeful beat. This gives hope that we may return back.</p> </li> <li> <p>Look Alive - SwuM</p> <p>This song relates to Ezekiel's vision of the bones in the valley. the lyrics of the song talk about how drake believed that he would never return to music after he left, similar to how Ezekiel believed that the dry bones would never come alive. The title also relates to the song because as soon as Ezekiel spoke the word of god, the bones came to life.</p> </li> <li> <p>Dream - Al Green</p> <p>This song serves as a bookend to the story of Ezekiel. When he is imprisoned in Babylon, he believes that he has already served his purpose of bringing hope to the people of Israel that they will someday return back to the promised land.

The priest Ezekiel was the first prophet to be called by God outside of Israel during the Babylonian Exile. Deported to Babylon by the river Chebar in 597 BC, Ezekiel - \u05d9\u05b0\u05d7\u05b6\u05d6\u05b0\u05e7\u05b5\u05d0\u05dc\u00a0_- was truly an exilic prophet, who foresaw both the Fall of Jerusalem in 586 BC, but also the Restoration of Israel and the Temple.  </p> <p>The central figure in the Book of Ezekiel is\u00a0God. ## CHAPTER 1 of the book opens with a unique vision of the glory of the LORD (1:28). The phrase_\u00a0\"You shall know that I am the LORD\"\u00a0_recurs 33 times throughout the text beginning at 6:7. While he punishes Israel for their idolatry and disobedience, his love for his creation mankind prevails in the end. God the Creator calls Ezekiel \"Son of Man\" 93 times. The Book of Ezekiel is generally divided into five parts: the Call of the Prophet (## CHAPTERs 1-3); Judgement until the Siege of Jerusalem (4-24); Judgement and Condemnation of Nations (25-32); Salvation for Israel (33-39); and the Restoration of Israel and the Temple (40-48).  </p> <p>The Book is both esoteric and fascinating in many ways, such as the description of his prophetic call. His reference to the prophet as Watchman for Israel (3 and 33) serves as an admonition for all of us to be watchmen for our own lives and our loved ones, as well as for our neighbor. Cherubim, of the higher order of\u00a0Angels, figure in the Book: the Glory of the LORD left the Temple of Jerusalem and rested upon the Cherubim (10:18). ## CHAPTER 11:14-21 speaks of God's future Restoration of the Exiles. Ezekiel mentions three Biblical figures in a row as men of righteousness, Noah, Daniel, and Job (14:14 and 14:20). Ezekiel utilizes the parable_\u00a0\u05de\u05b8\u05e9\u05b8\u05c1\u05dc\u00a0_- mashal - to convey his message, as seen in the Parable of the Two Eagles and Vine (17), and the Parable of the Pot (24). Ezekiel records the death of his wife in 24:18. God promises that, after his people have been led astray, He himself will shepherd his sheep (34:11-16), and give them a new heart and a new spirit (36:24-28).  </p> <p>His Vision of the Dry Bones in ## CHAPTER 37 as a symbol of the Restoration of Israel - and the Resurrection of the Dead - is perhaps the best known passage of Ezekiel.  </p> <p>Ezekiel of all the prophets is noteworthy for providing the timing of events. In the traditional way, Ezekiel noted the time of the fall of Jerusalem in 33:21, \"on the fifth day of the tenth month, in the twelfth year of our exile.\"  </p> <p>Ezekiel 38:23 serves as the inspiration for the Kaddish -_\u00a0\u05e7\u05d3\u05d9\ufb2a\u00a0_- \"holy\" in Aramaic, a hymn of praise to God, often said as the Mourner's Prayer.  </p> <p>Ezekiel 40:1 records Rosh Hashanah -_\u00a0\u05e8\u05b9\u05d0\u05e9\u05c1 \u05d4\u05b7\u05e9\u05b8\u05bc\u05c1\u05e0\u05b8\u05d4_, (in) \"the beginning of the year.\"  </p> <p>During the Restoration of Israel, Ezekiel foresaw the return of the glory -_\u00a0\u05db\u05bc\u05b0\u05d1\u05d5\u05b9\u05d3\u00a0_- kevod (construct form) - of the LORD to the Jerusalem Temple (43:4-5).  </p> <p>The Book serves as an important source for New Testament thought. Salvation by grace is prefigured in God giving a new heart (36:26) and pouring out his spirit (36:26, 39:29) to his people. Ezekiel 36:24-28 anticipates Baptism. The Book as a whole serves as a source of symbols and imagery for the Book of\u00a0Revelation, such as the eating of the scroll (Ezekiel 2:1-10 and Revelation 10:1-10), the darkening of the sun and moon (Ezekiel 32:7 and Revelation 6:12, and the references to Gog and Magog (Ezekiel 38-39 and Revelation 20:8)  </p> <p>The following Scripture is the Authorized King James Version of the Holy Bible, now in the public domain. King James I commissioned a group of Biblical scholars in 1604 to establish an authoritative translation of the Bible from the ancient languages and other translations at the time, and the work was completed in 1611.

And this was their appearance; they had the likeness of a man. 6 And every one had four faces, and every one had four wings. 7 And their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf's foot: and they sparkled like the colour of burnished brass.  </p> <p>8 And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides; and they four had their faces and their wings. 9 Their wings were joined one to another; they turned not when they went; they went every one straight forward.  </p> <p>10 As for the likeness of their faces, they four had the face of a man, and the face of a lion, on the right side: and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four also had the face of an eagle. 11 Thus were their faces: and their wings were stretched upward; two wings of every one were joined one to another, and two covered their bodies. 12 And they went every one straight forward: whither the spirit was to go, they went; and they turned not when they went. 13 As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, and like the appearance of lamps: it went up and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning. 14 And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning.  </p> <p>15 Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold one wheel upon the earth by the living creatures, with his four faces. 16 The appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto the colour of a beryl: and they four had one likeness: and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel. 17 When they went, they went upon their four sides: and they turned not when they went. 18 As for their rings, they were so high that they were dreadful; and their rings were full of eyes round about them four. 19 And when the living creatures went, the wheels went by them: and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up. 20 Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went, thither was their spirit to go; and the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels. 21 When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.  </p> <p>22 And the likeness of the firmament upon the heads of the living creature was as the colour of the terrible crystal, stretched forth over their heads above. 23 And under the firmament were their wings straight, the one toward the other: every one had two, which covered on this side, and every one had two, which covered on that side, their bodies. 24 And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, the voice of speech, as the noise of an host: when they stood, they let down their wings. 25 And there was a voice from the firmament that was over their heads, when they stood, and had let down their wings.  </p> <p>26 And above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone: and upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it. 27 And I saw as the colour of amber, as the appearance of fire round about within it, from the appearance of his loins even upward, and from the appearance of his loins even downward, I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness round about. 28 As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about.

Is this of thy whoredoms a small matter, 21 That thou hast slain my children, and delivered them to cause them to pass through the fire for them? 22 And in all thine abominations and thy whoredoms thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, when thou wast naked and bare, and wast polluted in thy blood.  </p> <p>23 And it came to pass after all thy wickedness, (woe, woe unto thee! saith the Lord GOD;) 24 That thou hast also built unto thee an eminent place, and hast made thee an high place in every street. 25 Thou hast built thy high place at every head of the way, and hast made thy beauty to be abhorred, and hast opened thy feet to every one that passed by, and multiplied thy whoredoms. 26 Thou hast also committed fornication with the Egyptians thy neighbours, great of flesh; and hast increased thy whoredoms, to provoke me to anger. 27 Behold, therefore I have stretched out my hand over thee, and have diminished thine ordinary food, and delivered thee unto the will of them that hate thee, the daughters of the Philistines, which are ashamed of thy lewd way. 28 Thou hast played the whore also with the Assyrians, because thou wast unsatiable; yea, thou hast played the harlot with them, and yet couldest not be satisfied. 29 Thou hast moreover multiplied thy fornication in the land of Canaan unto Chaldea; and yet thou wast not satisfied herewith.  </p> <p>30 How weak is thine heart, saith the Lord GOD, seeing thou doest all these things, the work of an imperious whorish woman; 31 In that thou buildest thine eminent place in the head of every way, and makest thine high place in every street; and hast not been as an harlot, in that thou scornest hire; 32 But as a wife that committeth adultery, which taketh strangers instead of her husband! 33 They give gifts to all whores: but thou givest thy gifts to all thy lovers, and hirest them, that they may come unto thee on every side for thy whoredom. 34 And the contrary is in thee from other women in thy whoredoms, whereas none followeth thee to commit whoredoms: and in that thou givest a reward, and no reward is given unto thee, therefore thou art contrary.  </p> <p>35 Wherefore, O harlot, hear the word of the LORD: 36 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thy filthiness was poured out, and thy nakedness discovered through thy whoredoms with thy lovers, and with all the idols of thy abominations, and by the blood of thy children, which thou didst give unto them; 37 Behold, therefore I will gather all thy lovers, with whom thou hast taken pleasure, and all them that thou hast loved, with all them that thou hast hated; I will even gather them round about against thee, and will discover thy nakedness unto them, that they may see all thy nakedness. 38 And I will judge thee, as women that break wedlock and shed blood are judged; and I will give thee blood in fury and jealousy. 39 And I will also give thee into their hand, and they shall throw down thine eminent place, and shall break down thy high places: they shall strip thee also of thy clothes, and shall take thy fair jewels, and leave thee naked and bare. 40 They shall also bring up a company against thee, and they shall stone thee with stones, and thrust thee through with their swords. 41 And they shall burn thine houses with fire, and execute judgments upon thee in the sight of many women: and I will cause thee to cease from playing the harlot, and thou also shalt give no hire any more. 42 So will I make my fury toward thee to rest, and my jealousy shall depart from thee, and I will be quiet, and will be no more angry. 43 Because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, but hast fretted me in all these things; behold, therefore I also will recompense thy way upon thine head, saith the Lord GOD: and thou shalt not commit this lewdness above all thine abominations.  </p> <p>44 Behold, every one that useth proverbs shall use this proverb against thee, saying, As is the mother, so is her daughter. 45 Thou art thy mother's daughter, that lotheth her husband and her children; and thou art the sister of thy sisters, which lothed their husbands and their children: your mother was an Hittite, and your father an Amorite. 46 And thine elder sister is Samaria, she and her daughters that dwell at thy left hand: and thy younger sister, that dwelleth at thy right hand, is Sodom and her daughters. 47 Yet hast thou not walked after their ways, nor done after their abominations: but, as if that were a very little thing, thou wast corrupted more than they in all thy ways. 48 As I live, saith the Lord GOD, Sodom thy sister hath not done, she nor her daughters, as thou hast done, thou and thy daughters. 49 Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom, pride, fullness of bread, and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters, neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy.  </p> <p>50 And they were haughty, and committed abomination before me: therefore I took them away as I saw good. 51 Neither hath Samaria committed half of thy sins; but thou hast multiplied thine abominations more than they, and hast justified thy sisters in all thine abominations which thou hast done. 52 Thou also, which hast judged thy sisters, bear thine own shame for thy sins that thou hast committed more abominable than they: they are more righteous than thou: yea, be thou confounded also, and bear thy shame, in that thou hast justified thy sisters.  </p> <p>53 When I shall bring again their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, then will I bring again the captivity of thy captives in the midst of them: 54 That thou mayest bear thine own shame, and mayest be confounded in all that thou hast done, in that thou art a comfort unto them. 55 When thy sisters, Sodom and her daughters, shall return to their former estate, and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former estate, then thou and thy daughters shall return to your former estate. 56 For thy sister Sodom was not mentioned by thy mouth in the day of thy pride, 57 Before thy wickedness was discovered, as at the time of thy reproach of the daughters of Syria, and all that are round about her, the daughters of the Philistines, which despise thee round about. 58 Thou hast borne thy lewdness and thine abominations, saith the LORD.  </p> <p>59 For thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even deal with thee as thou hast done, which hast despised the oath in breaking the covenant. 60 Nevertheless I will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth, and I will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant. 61 Then thou shalt remember thy ways, and be ashamed, when thou shalt receive thy sisters, thine elder and thy younger: and I will give them unto thee for daughters, but not by thy covenant. 62 And I will establish my covenant with thee; and thou shalt know that I am the LORD: 63 That thou mayest remember, and be confounded, and never open thy mouth any more because of thy shame, when I am pacified toward thee for all that thou hast done, saith the Lord GOD.</p>"},{"location":"Religion/Hebrew%20Scriptures/Unit%204%20-%20Prophet%20Project/The%20Book%20Of%20Ezekiel/#chapter-17","title":"CHAPTER 17","text":""},{"location":"Religion/Hebrew%20Scriptures/Unit%204%20-%20Prophet%20Project/The%20Book%20Of%20Ezekiel/#parable-of-the-eagles-and-vine","title":"Parable of the Eagles and Vine","text":"<p>1 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 2 Son of man, put forth a riddle, and speak a\u00a0parable\u00a0unto the house of Israel;

Thus were their names; Samaria is Aholah, and Jerusalem Aholibah. 5 And Aholah played the harlot when she was mine; and she doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians her neighbours, 6 Which were clothed with blue, captains and rulers, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding upon horses. 7 Thus she committed her whoredoms with them, with all them that were the chosen men of Assyria, and with all on whom she doted: with all their idols she defiled herself. 8 Neither left she her whoredoms brought from Egypt: for in her youth they lay with her, and they bruised the breasts of her virginity, and poured their whoredom upon her. 9 Wherefore I have delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians, upon whom she doted. 10 These discovered her nakedness: they took her sons and her daughters, and slew her with the sword: and she became famous among women; for they had executed judgment upon her.  </p> <p>11 And when her sister Aholibah saw this, she was more corrupt in her inordinate love than she, and in her whoredoms more than her sister in her whoredoms. 12 She doted upon the Assyrians her neighbours, captains and rulers clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding upon horses, all of them desirable young men. 13 Then I saw that she was defiled, that they took both one way, 14 And that she increased her whoredoms: for when she saw men pourtrayed upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans pourtrayed with vermilion, 15 Girded with girdles upon their loins, exceeding in dyed attire upon their heads, all of them princes to look to, after the manner of the Babylonians of Chaldea, the land of their nativity: 16 And as soon as she saw them with her eyes, she doted upon them, and sent messengers unto them into Chaldea. 17 And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their whoredom, and she was polluted with them, and her mind was alienated from them. 18 So she discovered her whoredoms, and discovered her nakedness: then my mind was alienated from her, like as my mind was alienated from her sister. 19 Yet she multiplied her whoredoms, in calling to remembrance the days of her youth, wherein she had played the harlot in the land of Egypt. 20 For she doted upon their paramours, whose flesh is as the flesh of asses, and whose issue is like the issue of horses.  </p> <p>21 Thus thou calledst to remembrance the lewdness of thy youth, in bruising thy teats by the Egyptians for the paps of thy youth. 22 There, O Aholibah, thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will raise up thy lovers against thee, from whom thy mind is alienated, and I will bring them against thee on every side; 23 The Babylonians, and all the Chaldeans, Pekod, and Shoa, and Koa, and all the Assyrians with them: all of them desirable young men, captains and rulers, great lords and renowned, all of them riding upon horses. 24 And they shall come against thee with chariots, wagons, and wheels, and with an assembly of people, which shall set against thee buckler and shield and helmet round about: and I will set judgment before them, and they shall judge thee according to their judgments. 25 And I will set my jealousy against thee, and they shall deal furiously with thee: they shall take away thy nose and thine ears; and thy remnant shall fall by the sword: they shall take thy sons and thy daughters; and thy residue shall be devoured by the fire. 26 They shall also strip thee out of thy clothes, and take away thy fair jewels. 27 Thus will I make thy lewdness to cease from thee, and thy whoredom brought from the land of Egypt: so that thou shalt not lift up thine eyes unto them, nor remember Egypt any more.  </p> <p>28 For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will deliver thee into the hand of them whom thou hatest, into the hand of them from whom thy mind is alienated: 29 And they shall deal with thee hatefully, and shall take away all thy labour, and shall leave thee naked and bare: and the nakedness of thy whoredoms shall be discovered, both thy lewdness and thy whoredoms. 30 I will do these things unto thee, because thou hast gone a whoring after the heathen, and because thou art polluted with their idols.  </p> <p>31 Thou hast walked in the way of thy sister; therefore will I give her cup into thine hand. 32 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Thou shalt drink of thy sister's cup deep and large: thou shalt be laughed to scorn and had in derision; it containeth much. 33 Thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, with the cup of astonishment and desolation, with the cup of thy sister Samaria.  </p> <p>34 Thou shalt even drink it and suck it out, and thou shalt break the sherds thereof, and pluck off thine own breasts: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord GOD. 35 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast forgotten me, and cast me behind thy back, therefore bear thou also thy lewdness and thy whoredoms.  </p> <p>36 The LORD said moreover unto me; Son of man, wilt thou judge Aholah and Aholibah?

The Book of Psalms consists of religious hymns, many written for use in Jewish worship. The Book of Job is a debate on why innocent people suffer.\u00a0 The Song of Songs is a love poem.\u00a0 The Books of Wisdom, Proverbs, and Sirach give advice on moral and virtuous living. And the Book of Ecclesiastes is a sort of journal on the purpose of human life.\u00a0 The most obvious common element among these books is the use of poetic language to convey their message. Not that these are the only books of the Old Testament that use poetry. But they make such extensive application of it that a little background on the nature of Hebrew poetry is helpful for reading them.</p> <p>The most important feature of Hebrew poetry is parallelism. Parallelism involves the repetition of words or ideas in successive lines of a verse. Sometimes the second line contrasts with the first:</p> <pre><code>The Lord Watches Over The Way of the just,\n\nbut the Way of the Wicked leads to ruin. (Psalm 1:6)\n</code></pre> <p>Other times, the second line completes the thought of the first:</p> <pre><code>The Lord looks down from heaven upon the human race,\n\nto see if even one is wise, if even one seeks God. (Psalm 14:2)\n</code></pre> <p>Still other times, the second line seems to restate the first line more forcefully:</p> <pre><code>For I know my offense;\n\nmy sin is always before me. (Psalm 51:5)\n</code></pre> <p>In its many forms, parallelism - not a rhythmic pattern or rhyming words - is the organizing principle of Hebrew poetry.</p> <p>Hebrew poetry also uses symbolic language that is characteristic of poetry in any language. This includes metaphors (\u201cLord, my rock, my fortress, my deliverer\u201d)\u00a0 and similes (\u201cAs a deer longs for streams of water, so my soul longs for you, Oh God\u201d).\u00a0 To appreciate the beauty of Old Testament poetry and feel its impact, we must be willing to wrestle with symbolic ways of interpreting words and phrases.\u00a0</p> <p>Write two original poetic lines using parallelism:</p> <p>The Lord blesses those who follow his rules.</p> <p>And punish those who fail to do so</p>","tags":["homework","review"]},{"location":"Religion/Hebrew%20Scriptures/Unit%205%20-%20Psalms/The%20Psalms%20Project/#background-book-of-psalms","title":"Background: Book of Psalms","text":"<p>Rock!

This shows that even though death plagues humanity, it will never catch god. In addition, the psalm contains `\"The peoples plea is that God not allow the present danger to wipe out the community that has been graciously established\"`. It was written after the exodus, meaning that the people of the new Israel believed that their community was sacred and should be spared from the cold hand of death. This Psalm suggests that god agrees that all life is sacred but it is not indefinite. It sends a message that you have a limited number of days, making life worth living is worth the effort. `\"Seventy is the sum of our years, || Eighty if we are strong, || and most of them are fruitless toil, || for they pass quickly and we drift away.(Ps 90:10)\"` By showing that the years of fruitless toil amount to nothing, the author further heightens the point that life is precious and should not be wasted in fruitless toil.

We also had each member of the team sketch design ideas so that everyone could be involved in the process and we could hear a variety of perspectives. Our initial designs consisted of a few unique components which we had never worked with before, namely a scissor lift, and a claw. We took the inspiration for the claw from a garbage truck, using rubber bands for tension and flexibility that would allow us to pick up the cone anywhere.</p> <p>For scissor lifts, we had 3 initial designs. There are single hinge, double hinge, and braided scissor lifts. We chose the braided scissor lift because it is more sturdy and accurate when connected twice to the base in comparison to the double hinge which lacks accuracy, and the single hinge which lacks stability. In the first design of our scissor lift, we were able to make a functioning mechanism that was able to move up and done very efficiently, but when we tested the scissor lift by mourning it with one pivot point, and a motor attached to the other end, we found that the torque required to push the scissor lift from its resting state was larger than even what the high torque motor could provide us. This meant we had to place an actuator to lift up the scissor lift to a manageable starting height, and from there we could use the motor to move the scissor lift up and down. However, this was too inefficient at opening the scissor lift,\u00a0 so we tried using a linear slide which we found was much faster.</p>"},{"location":"Robotics/2022-2023/16887/#linear-slide","title":"LINEAR SLIDE","text":"<p>In the initial state of the bot we began with a c-channel linear slide run by a 560rpm gobuilda motor.

We then decided to utilize a field oriented driving system, in which pushing up on the joystick always makes the robot move forward, regardless of which way the robot turned.

After testing how long it would take to create a circuit with a fully functional robot, we decided that cycling cones to the high poles while our alliance partner focuses on circuits would be most optimal, as we can nearly guarantee 18-20 cones stacked on the high junction. Although this is our preferred game strategy, going back to our central mission of adaptability, our robot is made in such a way that we can work with any type of alliance partner whether that means working together to make a circuit, or placing defensive cones on the opponent's side ground junctions to limit their movement.\u00a0</p>"},{"location":"Robotics/2022-2023/16887/#26-cad","title":"2.6 CAD","text":"<p>For my mechanical claw design, I began by measuring the plastic cones that I needed to pick up.

Like the mechanical claw, I 3D printed these gears using PLA material to ensure structural integrity.

Then using the custom Finite State Machine we created with our own SHPLib, with just the press of the A button, the robot will perform a set of predetermined actions based on the previous state.\u00a0</p> <p>For example, once the TeleOp period starts, when pressing \u2018A\u2019 the robot will pick up the cone, then raise the linear slide to the high pole position, after driving up and aligning the robot, when pressing \u2018A\u2019 again, the claw will open releasing the cone, and retract the linear slide to the bottom position where it is ready to pick up a cone again. With just the use of one button, we are able to consistently cycle all 20 human player cones on to high poles, or any other pole height in accordance with our pre-planned alliance game strategy.

For example, if the encoder value is 1000 when picking up the 5th cone from the stack, once that action is completed, the state will change to hold a value of 800 corresponding with the 4th cone in the stack and so on.\u00a0</p>"},{"location":"Robotics/2022-2023/16887/#3-team-plan","title":"3.

The school is very supportive of both robotics and our other STEM programs and recognizes the importance of instilling these skills in our students. As a result, we have received significant funding as well as lab space inside and outside of our school. For the most part, we are able to procure whatever machinery/supplies that are necessary, within reason. This allows us to participate at a high level at competition. The business team of SHP Robotics plans to financially support our team\u2019s FIRST robots and other projects, educate our members using the latest technology available within our budget and serve our community by hosting STEM activities such as an outreach program that we currently provide at a local youth center. The goals of our strategic plan are to fundraise as much money as possible so we can pay for team travel, registration fees, and all other expenses, while having leftover money to serve our community through meaningful interactions that promote STEM and solve problems with our innovative ideas. While we do receive a large amount of support from our school and the more involved parents, we also pursue our own independent fundraising projects. These are led and managed by our own business division, with as little reliance on our adult mentors as possible.\u00a0</p> <p>Members of our strategic team reach out to parent, local, and company sponsors via meetings and email to tell potential investors about the success of our team and what we can accomplish with financial assistance. For their investment, we offer sponsors an opportunity to meet and connect with our team, a tour of our makerspace, explanations of our robots and other projects, and prime spots for their logos/ names on our robot, website and competition merchandise.\u00a0</p> <p>This year, we have secured sponsors for smaller local businesses like the Xie Foundation and Orthoworks as well as some larger companies like Thumbtacks to fund our parts orders, food, travel costs and general robotics maintenance. Our fundraising process generally consists of two main steps. First, our business leaders send out emails to potential sponsors and team parents encouraging them to donate to our team, usually towards the purpose of procuring a certain piece of equipment. We believe that transparency is very important, and that everyone who is generous enough to donate should know exactly where their money is going. This ties in directly to our second step, which is offering tours of our facilities and meetings with the team for any sponsors who wish to attend. While these tours are led by business team members, financial partners have the chance to meet the rest of our team and explore our facilities. It is our goal to give our sponsors as much information as possible, as they are investing in our team\u2019s future and providing us the resources we need to continue to grow.</p>"},{"location":"Robotics/2022-2023/16887/#32-outreach","title":"3.2 Outreach","text":"<p>It was important for us to have all our members participate in outreach activities so that we make a positive impact on our community. To do this, we have directly partnered with three different organizations that search to teach under-privileged children STEM. This year, the robotics team is hoping to get every member involved in outreach and is doing so by partnering with nonprofits organizations Robotics for All, Bit By Bit Coding, and Launch Coders.\u00a0</p> <p>Our guiding principle with regards to outreach is to serve at the local, state, and national level. During a typical academic year, we host courses on our campus for students from the local Siena Youth Center, teaching them basic engineering and code concepts that get them excited about STEM-based career paths. We also do occasional work with the East Palo Alto Boys and Girls Club, often bringing old competition robots and code demos for Curieus-sponsored TechFairs. On a larger scale, we heavily encourage our volunteers to work with our partner organizations, who now, due to the pandemic, host online courses.\u00a0 Because of the virtual option, students have had the opportunity to participate in community service activities at their pace and on a more flexible schedule. The flexibility they offered allowed students with sports commitments to volunteer and still have the time to focus on their other activities has resulted in more students on our team participating in service in some form this year.\u00a0</p> <p>Lastly, being located in the heart of Silicon Valley, our team does a lot of work with companies and mentors from the tech industry to expose our own members to STEM careers and workplace environments. Using our parental connections as well as reaching out to local companies, we have had guest speakers, one-day mentors, and lab tours from various experts and companies over the years. Though we have not done much work with this kind of outreach this year due to limitations of the pandemic, we plan to continue as soon as it is safe to proceed.</p> <p>Because our team comes from a background of financial privilege, we feel a great responsibility to give back to our community that enriches not only the lives of those we serve, but contributes to building a more diverse community of STEM leaders from our generation. We want to be able to give the opportunities and exposure to STEM that we have had to those without that same experience, a guiding principle of not only our team, but our robotics program as a whole.</p>"},{"location":"Robotics/2022-2023/16887/#33-team-sustainability","title":"3.3 Team Sustainability","text":"<p>As a team, community bonding is very important.

Although we attend the same school, there are many students at Sacred Heart Preparatory, and, especially in light of the pandemic, many of us had not met before joining the robotics team. By cementing a positive team environment through friendships, not only will we be able to work efficiently short term, but we will also make lasting relations that will carry us through our four years in high school.</p> <p>One of the features that makes the RGB special is that we have a variety of ages, grades, and experiences on our team. The more experienced upperclassmen can teach the younger, inexperienced members to learn. Knowledge of how to build something will stay with the members and help them grow into experienced builders, coders, and CADers. As the current underclassmen become upperclassmen, they can then teach newcomers on the process of creating a robot. In terms of new members, since team 16887 is part of a school, new students interested in robotics will join every year through all school emails, club fairs, and other opportunities to recruit new members. We can maintain the legacy of the RGB. From there, we divide the students across our teams and projects, which is why it is important that the underclassmen gain experience and understanding now. Once the teams are recreated year by year, the number stays the same while the members change, so the process of teaching keeps being handed down.\u00a0</p>"},{"location":"Robotics/2022-2023/16887/#4-program-plan","title":"4.

We are writing to provide a follow-up on the progress of our project and thank you again for your generous support. First, thank you for your continued support of our project from beginning to end. From a plan formulated at the beginning of 2021, we can proudly say that we have successfully achieved our goal of providing clean and accessible water to the Maasai community in Monduli by constructing our 100,000-liter tank in Losimingori. In the past six months since we built the tank, it has supported over five-thousand people in the area with clean water, especially during the dry season, when it is challenging to find water.</p> <p>This year, our goal was to raise $30,000 for another water tank of a similar size. Still, after careful consideration and consultation with student leaders and community members, we split the funds into three projects to be more effective and water efficient for the community. These projects focused on improving water accessibility and infrastructure in the region. Two of the projects are 40,000-liter water tanks constructed around Losimingori and Nanja and have already begun to impact their community. The third project is a filtration system for a homemade pond that will provide cleaner water to those nearby.</p> <p>This year, eight student leaders joined the efforts to continue what we started. After months of preparation, we collected on-ground for the first time on December 19th. We spent five jam-packed days collecting data about the impact of the current water harvesting unit through nearly 40 interviews with local community members. </p> <p>After our on-ground research, we are happy to report that the current water harvesting unit has successfully and significantly impacted the Maasai community's daily lives. The women no longer have to walk long distances to fetch water, and children can attend school without the burden of survival tasks. The current water harvesting unit saved an average of over 8 hours of walking per day. According to local teachers, the enrollment and engagement in class has doubled since the water tank was built. This has opened up opportunities for education and economic growth within the community. For example, the water tank allows many Maasai to focus on agriculture to further support their families financially. We could have never guessed how life-changing this water harvesting unit could be to the community.</p> <p>In addition to research, some of our student leaders hosted workshops for several skills. Our most crucial workshop was the technology literacy course. This course taught underprivileged Maasai the necessary tech skills required to succeed in our modern world. Other workshops included art, dance, and singing sessions, which were undoubtedly fun to participate in and enjoy. </p> <p>Towards the end of our visit, we hosted an offsite with community members to brainstorm other potential solutions to the water harvesting problem besides just water tanks. The experience was very enlightening as the community provided several insights on issues we didn't know existed, helping us brainstorm at full capacity as a team. The result was a large selection of ideas, all of which can be prototyped and perhaps implemented at scale.</p> <p>In the future, we plan to create a program that subsidizes part of the cost of smaller, low-cost water harvesting units. This will make it easier for families in more remote areas to access clean water. This will be a crucial step towards providing clean water to the 55,000 people living in Monduli.</p> <p>As of right now, our student leaders are sifting through the data and insights we gathered during our stay in Tanzania to put together a presentation for the Lions Club Global Summit in March this year.</p> <p>We are grateful for your support and are committed to continuing our work toward providing clean and accessible water to the Maasai community. If you have any questions about the data collected, feel free to reach out to anyone on our team, and we will be sure to reach out to you.</p> <p>Sincerely,</p> <p>The Water Harvesting Team</p>"},{"location":"Tanzania%20Prep/11-27-2022%20Call%20with%20Ayushi-Deepak/","title":"Questions","text":"Demographic Qualitative Questions Quantitative Questions General Questions Men(Older Than Morans) Morans Women Children Teacher Government Official"},{"location":"Tanzania%20Prep/11-29-2022%20Call%20with%20Kanishk%2C%20Adam%2C%20Arhaan/","title":"11 29 2022 Call with Kanishk, Adam, Arhaan","text":""},{"location":"Tanzania%20Prep/11-29-2022%20Call%20with%20Kanishk%2C%20Adam%2C%20Arhaan/#meeting-notes","title":"Meeting notes","text":"<ul> <li>Need a marketing PDF</li> <li>Send out email with all marker</li> <li></li> </ul>"},{"location":"Tanzania%20Prep/11-29-2022%20Call%20with%20Kanishk%2C%20Adam%2C%20Arhaan/#25-tips-to-coldcalling","title":"25 tips to Coldcalling","text":""},{"location":"Tanzania%20Prep/11-29-2022%20Call%20with%20Kanishk%2C%20Adam%2C%20Arhaan/#1-research-research-research","title":"1.

Except for some elders living in rural areas, most Maasai people also speak the official languages of Kenya and Tanzania, Swahili and English.</p> <p>The Maasai tribe is known for its proud identity and long-preserved culture. As one of the oldest tribes in the world, the Maasai have a rich culture and language. The tribe in Monduli in Arusha lives a nomadic life. The women walk nearly 9 hours daily to fetch water, and the children often sacrifice due to the social stigma around education in their community and a necessity for survival. Instead of schooling, most Maasai children will tend to cattle while their mothers collect water. This community's lack of clean, accessible water is a huge bottleneck.</p> <p>The premise of this project is to mitigate or solve the lack of accessible and clean water for everyone in the Monduli District. This project will benefit 50,000+ Maasai and allow them easy access to clean and accessible water. Through this project, we can help the Maasai of Arusha grow economically and educationally.

This pioneering project, centered around the installation of a 100k litre water harvesting unit, is not only a beacon of hope for this community but also a compelling case study for sustainable water management strategies worldwide.</p> <p>The water harvesting project in the Monduli District, Arusha, Tanzania, is a testament to the power of sustainable solutions in addressing critical issues such as water scarcity. By installing a 100k litre water harvesting unit, the project has significantly improved the well-being of the Maasai community, particularly women and children, who previously had to walk for hours to fetch water. The project has not only provided a reliable source of clean water but also freed up time for economic activities and education, thereby enhancing the community's overall quality of life.</p> <p>The project's impact extends beyond the immediate community. By demonstrating the effectiveness of water harvesting units, it provides a blueprint for similar interventions in other water-scarce regions. This could potentially improve the lives of millions of people worldwide who lack access to clean water, a fundamental human right.</p> <p>Moreover, the project contributes to the future of our planet by promoting sustainable water management. Water scarcity is a global issue, exacerbated by climate change and population growth. Traditional water sources are becoming increasingly unreliable, and overuse of existing resources is depleting groundwater reserves. Water harvesting offers a sustainable alternative by making use of rainfall, a renewable resource. It reduces reliance on groundwater and helps preserve this precious resource for future generations.</p> <p>Furthermore, the project is planning to introduce a universal water harvesting unit and additional filtration systems, indicating a commitment to continuous improvement and scalability. This approach ensures that the benefits of the project can be extended to a larger population, amplifying its positive impact.</p> <p>In conclusion, the water harvesting project in Monduli District is a shining example of how sustainable interventions can improve people's well-being and contribute to the future of our planet. By addressing water scarcity in a sustainable manner, the project is making a significant contribution to achieving the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal of ensuring access to clean water and sanitation for all</p>"},{"location":"Tanzania%20Prep/NGFP%20YOung%20Voices%20Award%202023%20Submission/#prompt_1","title":"Prompt","text":""},{"location":"Tanzania%20Prep/NGFP%20YOung%20Voices%20Award%202023%20Submission/#video-script","title":"Video Script","text":"<p>[FADE IN]</p> <p>[SHOT of the speaker standing in front of the water harvesting unit]</p> <p>SPEAKER: \"Hello, I'm [Speaker's Name], and I'm here to talk about a project that's changing lives in our community - the water harvesting unit installed by Maji Wells.</p> <p>[SHOT of Maasai community members using the water harvesting unit]</p> <p>SPEAKER (V.O.): \"This unit is more than just a structure; it's a lifeline for over 4500 Maasai community members.

Introduction A. Background of the Great Gatsby B. Thesis statement: The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald is a timeless classic that stands out for its poetic and elusive language, intricate characterization, and the exploration of the human condition.</p> <p>II. Poetic Language </p> <ul> <li>A. Description of the moonlit night<ul> <li>\"One autumn night, five years before, they had been walking down the street when the leaves were falling, and they came to a place where there were no trees and the sidewalk was white with moonlight.\"</li> </ul> </li> <li>B. Imagery of climbing the ladder to the secret place<ul> <li>\"Out of the corner of his eye Gatsby saw that the blocks of the sidewalks really formed a ladder and mounted to a secret place above the trees \u2014 he could climb to it, if he climbed alone, and once there he could suck on the pap of life, gulp down the incomparable milk of wonder.\"</li> </ul> </li> <li>C. Sensual description of the kiss<ul> <li>\"Then he kissed her. At his lips\u2019 touch she blossomed for him like a flower and the incarnation was complete.\" D. Analysis of the poetic language's impact on the reader</li> </ul> </li> <li>Fitzgerald's poetic language creates a dreamlike and romantic atmosphere, which draws the reader into the novel's world of glamour and excess.</li> </ul> <p>III. Elusive Characterization  - A. Gatsby's character and motivations     -  Gatsby's motivations are mysterious and difficult to discern, as Nick observes: \"He smiled understandingly\u2014much more than understandingly. It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in life. It faced\u2014or seemed to face\u2014the whole external world for an instant, and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favor. It understood you just so far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself, and assured you that it had precisely the impression of you that, at your best, you hoped to convey.\" - B. Daisy's character and motivations     -  Daisy's character is similarly elusive, as Nick notes: \"Her face was sad and lovely with bright things in it, bright eyes and a bright passionate mouth, but there was an excitement in her voice that men who had cared for her found difficult to forget: a singing compulsion, a whispered \"Listen,\" a promise that she had done gay, exciting things just a while since and that there were gay, exciting things hovering in the next hour.\" - C. Nick's perception of the characters     -  Nick's own perception of the characters is also complex, as he struggles to understand their motivations and actions. He reflects: \"I am still a little afraid of missing something if I forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly repeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is parceled out unequally at birth.\" - D. Analysis of how the characters' elusive nature affects the novel's meaning     -   The novel's characters are intentionally elusive, representing the illusions and facades of the Jazz Age. By refusing to be easily defined or understood, the characters become symbols of the emptiness and disillusionment of the era.</p> <p>IV. Exploration of the Human Condition - A. Themes of love, desire, and longing     -   The novel explores the intense desire and longing of its characters, as seen in Gatsby's love for Daisy and Daisy's desire for wealth and social status. As Nick reflects: \"He knew that when he kissed this girl, and forever wed his unutterable visions to her perishable breath, his mind would never romp again like the mind of God.\" - B. Themes of social class, wealth, and power     -   The novel also explores the themes of social class, wealth, and power, as seen in the opulence of Gatsby's parties and the characters' obsession with wealth and status. Nick observes: \"I was within and without, simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life.\" - C. Critique of the American Dream     -   Although the prompt asks us not to use the phrase \"American Dream,\" it is impossible to discuss The Great Gatsby without acknowledging its critique of the American Dream. The characters' relentless pursuit of wealth and success ultimately leads to their downfall, exposing the hollowness of the American Dream and the dark underbelly of the Jazz Age. As Nick reflects: \"They were careless people, Tom and Daisy \u2014 they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made.\"</p> <p>V. Conclusion A. Restate thesis statement B. Summarize key points C. Final thoughts</p> <ul> <li>The Great Gatsby remains a timeless classic not only for its stunning prose and intricate characterization but also for its exploration of the human condition and its critique of the American Dream. Fitzgerald's novel invites us to reflect on the allure of wealth and success, the fleeting nature of happiness, and the consequences of our actions.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"US%20Literature/Hamilton/Alexander%20Hamilton%20Lyrics/","title":"Alexander Hamilton","text":"<p>How does a bastard, orphan, son of a whore And a Scotsman, dropped in the middle of a forgotten spot In the Caribbean by providence impoverished In squalor, grow up to be a hero and a scholar?</p> <p>The ten-dollar founding father without a father Got a lot farther by working a lot harder By being a lot smarter By being a self-starter By fourteen, they placed him in charge of a trading charter</p> <p>And every day while slaves were being slaughtered and carted away Across the waves, he struggled and kept his guard up Inside, he was longing for something to be a part of The brother was ready to beg, steal, borrow, or barter</p> <p>Then a hurricane came, and devastation reigned Our man saw his future drip, dripping down the drain Put a pencil to his temple, connected it to his brain And he wrote his first refrain, a testament to his pain</p> <p>Well, the word got around, they said, this kid is insane, man Took up a collection just to send him to the mainland Get your education, don't forget from whence you came And the world is gonna know your name What's your name, man?</p> <p>Alexander Hamilton My name is Alexander Hamilton And there's a million things I haven't done But just you wait, just you wait</p> <p>When he was ten his father split, full of it, debt-ridden Two years later, see Alex and his mother bed-ridden Half-dead sittin' in their own sick, the scent thick</p> <p>And Alex got better but his mother went quick</p> <p>Moved in with a cousin, the cousin committed suicide Left him with nothin' but ruined pride, something new inside A voice saying, \"Alex, you gotta fend for yourself\"</p> <p>He started retreatin' and readin' every treatise on the shelf</p> <p>There would have been nothin' left to do for someone less astute He woulda been dead or destitute without a cent of restitution Started workin', clerkin' for his late mother's landlord Tradin' sugar cane and rum and all the things he can't afford Scammin' for every book he can get his hands on Plannin' for the future see him now as he stands on The bow of a ship headed for the new land In New York you can be a new man</p> <p>In New York you can be a new man (just you wait) In New York you can be a new man (just you wait) In New York you can be a new man</p> <p>In New York, New York Just you wait</p> <p>Alexander Hamilton</p> <p>Alexander Hamilton</p> <p>We are waiting in the wings for you</p> <p>Waiting in the wings for you</p> <p>You could never back down You never learned to take your time</p> <p>Oh, Alexander Hamilton</p> <p>Alexander Hamilton</p> <p>When America sings for you Will they know what you overcame?

The song's historical and narrative moment, set during the American Revolution, serves as a backdrop for Hamilton's aspirations and desires, which are reinforced through various strategies and devices that are typical of Miranda's style.</p> <p>One key aspect of Hamilton's character and ambition that is revealed through the language of the song is his relentless pursuit of success and recognition. Hamilton is depicted as someone who is constantly striving to make the most of his opportunities and rise above his humble beginnings. This is evident in lines such as \"I am not throwing away my shot\" and \"I gotta get in the game, the game is mine.\" The repetition of the phrase \"my shot\" reinforces Hamilton's determination to seize every chance that comes his way and make a name for himself.</p> <p>The use of allusion is also prominent in the song, with references to historical figures and events. For example, Hamilton compares himself to other notable figures such as \"Hercules Mulligan\" and \"John Laurens,\" drawing parallels between his own ambitions and the achievements of these individuals. This use of allusion serves to highlight Hamilton's desire for greatness and his belief that he can make a lasting impact on history.</p> <p>Repetition is a powerful rhetorical device used in \"My Shot\" to emphasize Hamilton's determination and drive. The repeated use of phrases such as \"I am not throwing away my shot\" and \"I'm just like my country, I'm young, scrappy, and hungry\" creates a sense of urgency and reinforces Hamilton's unwavering pursuit of his goals. The use of anaphora, or the repetition of the same word or phrase at the beginning of successive clauses, such as \"I gotta\" and \"I'm not,\" further reinforces Hamilton's single-minded focus and determination.</p> <p>The song's imagery also serves to reinforce Hamilton's character and ambitions. For example, the line \"And when I meet Thomas Jefferson, I'mma compel him to include women in the sequel\" creates a vivid image of Hamilton's determination to challenge the status quo and fight for equality, even in the face of adversity. This imagery serves to highlight Hamilton's progressive ideals and his willingness to go against the norm to achieve his goals.</p> <p>Furthermore, the song's rhythm and meter contribute to the portrayal of Hamilton's character. The fast-paced, energetic rhythm of the song reflects Hamilton's relentless drive and ambition, as well as his restless spirit. The use of internal and multisyllabic rhyme, such as \"Hercules Mulligan, I need no introduction\" and \"I'm just like my country, I'm young, scrappy, and hungry,\" adds musicality and depth to the lyrics, creating a memorable and engaging portrayal of Hamilton's character.</p> <p>In conclusion, \"My Shot\" reveals Alexander Hamilton as a determined and ambitious character who is willing to do whatever it takes to achieve his goals. Through the use of various strategies and devices such as allusion, repetition, imagery, and rhythm/meter, Lin-Manuel Miranda effectively reinforces our understanding of Hamilton's character and his desires. Hamilton's relentless pursuit of success, his progressive ideals, and his unwavering determination are all highlighted in the song, providing insight into his multifaceted personality and motivations, particularly in the historical and narrative moment of the American Revolution.</p>","tags":["English"]},{"location":"US%20Literature/Hamilton/Paragraph%20Explication/#bullet-pointed-list","title":"Bullet-pointed List","text":"<ul> <li>\"My Shot\" from the musical \"Hamilton\" reveals Alexander Hamilton as an ambitious and determined character who knows what he wants.</li> <li>Hamilton's character and ambitions are reinforced through various strategies and devices used in the song, such as:<ul> <li>Allusion: \"I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory\" alludes to Hamilton's relentless pursuit of success despite the constant threat of death during the Revolutionary War.</li> <li>Repetition: \"I am not throwing away my shot\" and \"I'm just like my country, I'm young, scrappy, and hungry\" are repeated, emphasizing Hamilton's determination and hunger for success.</li> <li>Anaphora: \"I gotta\" and \"I'm not\" repeated at the beginning of successive clauses highlight Hamilton's single-minded focus on his goals.</li> <li>Imagery: \"And when I meet Thomas Jefferson, I'mma compel him to include women in the sequel\" creates a vivid image of Hamilton's determination to challenge the status quo and advocate for gender equality.</li> <li>Rhythm/meter: The fast-paced, energetic rhythm with internal and multisyllabic rhyme reflects Hamilton's relentless drive and adds musicality to the lyrics.</li> </ul> </li> <li>\"I am not throwing away my shot\" - This quote from the song showcases Hamilton's determination to seize every opportunity that comes his way and make the most of it.</li> <li>\"I'm just like my country, I'm young, scrappy, and hungry\" - This quote reflects Hamilton's identification with the emerging United States and his eagerness to make a name for himself in the new nation.</li> <li>\"I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory\" - This quote portrays Hamilton as someone who is willing to take risks and face death to achieve his ambitions.</li> <li>The song portrays Hamilton as a multifaceted character who is willing to fight for his ideals, challenge the status quo, and seize opportunities to fulfill his ambitions despite the risks involved.</li> <li>Through the use of these strategies and devices, Lin-Manuel Miranda effectively reinforces Hamilton's character and ambitions in \"My Shot,\" providing insight into his personality and motivations during the historical and narrative moment of the American Revolution.</li> </ul>","tags":["English"]},{"location":"US%20Literature/Hamilton/README-Hamilton/","title":"README Hamilton","text":"<p>%% Zoottelkeeper: Beginning of the autogenerated index file list  %% - \ud83d\udcc4 Alexander Hamilton Lyrics - \ud83d\udcc4 Paragraph Explication - \ud83d\udcc4 Unsung Stories Journal - \ud83d\udcc4 Unsung story lyrics %% Zoottelkeeper: End of the autogenerated index file list  %%</p>"},{"location":"US%20Literature/Hamilton/Unsung%20Stories%20Journal/","title":"Unsung Stories Journal","text":"<p>In your journal/Moleskin please respond to the following prompts to help you get prepared for your final project:\u00a0</p> <ul> <li>Which unsung American figure would you like to write about for your final project?

Emily rubbed her thumb over the faint scar on her thigh, the skin tough and knotted from the stitches. The scar, like her childhood, was chaotic and unstable, a raggedy gash of screaming and sadness. The memories flooded her mind, and in a moment, she was no longer in the bank but in the household of her youth.\u00a0</p> <p>At ten years old, with dark brown hair, Emily loved her father. Her earliest memories of her father were his short brown hair and the smell of aftershave. He used to buy her toys and take her to the movies, and she would sit in his lap and listen to him tell stories.\u00a0 He was a construction worker by trade but a father at heart. But he had his dark moments\u00a0</p> <p>One night her father came home late; she peeked out of her bedroom door to see him stumbling around the living room, knocking over furniture and slurring his words.</p> <p>\u201cWe can't keep living like this, John\u201d, Emily\u2019s mother said with a shaky voice, \u201cour daughter can't keep living like this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d John, Emily\u2019s father, replied with a sneer, \u201cyou want to leave me, you think you can take this away from me?\u201d</p> <p>\"No, I don't want to leave you,\" Emily's mother said, fear creeping into her voice. \"But I can't keep putting up with this. You need to get help, John. You need to get sober.\"</p> <p>\"I don't need help!\" John yelled, slamming his fist on the table. \"You're the one who needs to get in line. And if you try to take my life away from me, I'll make sure you regret it.\"</p> <p>Her father wasn't always unpredictable and frightening. There was a time when it seemed like everything would get better. John started to go to rehab, and her mother got a job.</p> <p>But as Emily grew older, she learned that addiction was a monster that didn't go away easily. The monster consumed her father, and every time he fell, he brought the family down with him. Emily watched as her mother tried to keep the family together, but the stress was too much, and they often found themselves arguing.</p> <p>One day, when Emily was fifteen, her father came home from a bar in a drunken stupor. He stumbled into Emily's room, and without warning, he hit her with a bottle. Emily fell to the ground, clutching her thigh, blood spilling out of the wound. \"I hate you!\" Emily screamed as her father ran out of the house. \"I wish you were dead!\" </p> <p>Emily's mother rushed her to the hospital, and the doctors stitched up her wound. When her father didn't come home, they assumed he had passed out somewhere. But the next morning, they learned that he had died in a motorcycle accident. The news left Emily feeling numb. Despite everything, he was still her father. </p> <p>Years passed, and Emily grew up, but the scar on her thigh remained. It was a reminder of her past, of the loss of innocence and the pain that came with it. But she had learned to live with it, to accept that sometimes, scars are a part of life. </p> <p>As Emily sat in the bank lobby, waiting for the loan officer to call her, she thought about her father. She wondered what he would think of her now, of the woman she had become. She wondered if he would be proud of her or if he would have been disappointed that she hadn't followed in his footsteps. But Emily knew that her father's addiction was not her burden to bear. She had come a long way from the scared little girl who had been hit with a bottle. She had worked hard to build a life for herself, to make something of herself despite the odds. She had found her strength in the midst of the chaos and had become the woman she was today. As the loan officer called her name, Emily stood up and walked towards his office, her hand rubbing over the scar on her thigh. She was ready to take the next step in her life, to move forward and leave the past behind.</p> <p>The loan officer greeted Emily with a smile, but she could sense his hesitation as he reviewed her credit history. She had worked hard to repair her credit after years of struggling, but the scarlet letter of debt still haunted her. \"I'm sorry, Miss. Smith,\" the loan officer said, shaking his head, \"but I'm afraid we won't be able to approve your loan application. Your credit score is still too low.\" Emily's heart sank, and she felt tears welling up in her eyes. She had been so close to finally achieving her dream of starting her own business. \"But I can give you some resources and advice on how to improve your credit,\" the loan officer continued, \"there are also some other options you can explore, like crowdfunding or microloans.\" Emily took a deep breath, wiping away the tears. She realized that this setback was not the end of her journey, just a detour. She thanked the loan officer for his help and left the bank, determined to keep moving forward. As she walked down the street, Emily noticed a poster for a local fundraiser for addiction recovery. The image on the poster was of a broken chain, symbolizing the breaking of addiction's hold. </p> <p>Emily thought about her father and the chains of addiction that had gripped him. She realized that his addiction had not only scarred her physically but emotionally and mentally as well. Emily decided to attend the fundraiser and offer her support. She knew that she couldn't change the past, but she could help others who were struggling with addiction. At the fundraiser, Emily saw people of all ages and backgrounds, sharing their stories of addiction and recovery. She felt a sense of camaraderie with them, knowing that she wasn't alone in her struggles. She met a woman named Susan, who had overcome addiction and was now a successful entrepreneur. Susan offered to mentor Emily and help her with her business plan. Over the next few months, Emily worked tirelessly on her business plan and reached out to potential investors. With Susan's guidance and support, she was able to secure the funding she needed to start her business. Emily opened a bakery that specialized in gluten-free and vegan treats, which became an instant hit in the community. Emily realized that her scar was not a symbol of her past but a reminder of her strength and resilience. She had overcome the odds and built a successful business, despite the challenges she had faced. As she closed up the bakery one evening, Emily rubbed her hand over the scar on her thigh, feeling a sense of gratitude. She knew that she wouldn't be where she was today if it weren't for the struggles she had faced. She had turned her scars into stars and had found meaning in the chaos.</p> <p>I miss having funny stories.</p>"},{"location":"US%20Literature/Unit%202/Podcast%20Prep/Beatsheet/","title":"Beatsheet","text":"<p>Beat #1: Opening -   Names: Brady, Andy, Roshan, Lucas -   Sophomore English students at SHP -   Personal intros</p> <p>Beat #2: Intro -   Episode Title: A Dehumanizing America -   Topic: Frederick Douglass, the enslaved narrative, and the legacies of slavery -   Aspects interesting to us -   How the narrative influenced our understanding of slavery as a whole -   What we hope is interesting for listeners -   What we want them to take away from the podcast</p> <p>Beat #3 - #: Main events -   First thing you notice: cruelty of slaveholders, dehumanization of the enslaved, and the breakup of families -   General unfairness, injustice, and lack of logic of slavery -   An enslaved person will try to escape despite the risks -   Hypocrisy of Christianity -   Why was slavery justified?

As a group, we have recently finished reading Douglass's powerful account of his experiences as an enslaved person in the United States, and we will be sharing our thoughts on how this book has deepened our understanding of slavery as an institution and its ongoing impact on American culture and society.</p> <p>In the Narrative, Douglass describes in harrowing detail the brutalities of slavery and the psychological toll it took on enslaved individuals. Through his writing, Douglass offers a powerful critique of the institution of slavery and its dehumanizing effects.</p> <p>One of the most powerful aspects of the Narrative for us was Douglass's use of rhetorical appeals to make his argument against slavery. He expertly employs pathos, using emotional language and vivid descriptions of his own experiences to draw the reader in and make them feel the pain and suffering of enslaved people. Douglass also uses logos, using logical arguments and evidence to show the immorality and injustice of slavery.</p> <p>In addition to the Narrative, we have also studied several other texts that have deepened our understanding of slavery's legacy on American culture and society. The Slate animation of the Middle Passage, for example, offered a poignant visual representation of the horrors of the transatlantic slave trade and the unimaginable suffering of enslaved people. The sorrow songs we studied, such as \"Steal Away\" and \"Wade in the Water,\" offered a glimpse into the emotional lives of enslaved people and the ways in which they used music to express their pain and hope for freedom.</p> <p>Overall, our readings and discussions have shown us the devastating impact of slavery on both enslaved individuals and American society as a whole. The continued legacy of slavery can be seen in the persistent racial inequalities and injustices that continue to plague American society. As we move forward, it is important for us to continue to engage with and learn from texts like the Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass in order to better understand the past and work towards a more just and equitable future.</p> <p>Let me hand it off to Andy, \"what is the first thing you noticed about the narrative?\"</p>"},{"location":"US%20Literature/Unit%202/Podcast%20Prep/Notes%20for%20Podcast/#podcast-beatsheet-the-horrors-of-slavery","title":"Podcast Beatsheet: The Horrors of Slavery","text":""},{"location":"US%20Literature/Unit%202/Podcast%20Prep/Notes%20for%20Podcast/#segment-1-background-on-slavery-in-the-united-states","title":"Segment 1: Background on slavery in the United States","text":"<p>Brief history of slavery in the United States, including how it was justified and the role it played in the country's economy</p> <p>The dehumanizing effects of slavery, including the separation of families and the denial of basic human rights</p>"},{"location":"US%20Literature/Unit%202/Podcast%20Prep/Notes%20for%20Podcast/#segment-2-the-narrative-of-frederick-douglass","title":"Segment 2: The narrative of Frederick Douglass","text":"<p>Introduction to Frederick Douglass, a former slave who became a prominent abolitionist and writer</p> <p>Discussion of Douglass' narrative, in which he describes his experiences as a slave and his eventual escape to freedom</p> <p>The importance of Douglass' narrative in shedding light on the realities of slavery and its impact on those who were forced to endure it</p>"},{"location":"US%20Literature/Unit%202/Podcast%20Prep/Notes%20for%20Podcast/#segment-3-the-movie-get-out-and-its-portrayal-of-slavery","title":"Segment 3: The movie \"Get Out\" and its portrayal of slavery","text":"<p>Introduction to the movie \"Get Out,\" a horror film that explores the theme of slavery in a contemporary setting</p> <p>Discussion of how the movie uses the concept of \"the sunken place\" to represent the psychological effects of slavery on its victims</p> <p>The relevance of \"Get Out\" in addressing the ongoing legacy of slavery in the United States</p>"},{"location":"US%20Literature/Unit%202/Podcast%20Prep/README-Podcast%20Prep/","title":"README Podcast Prep","text":"<p>%% Zoottelkeeper: Beginning of the autogenerated index file list  %% - \ud83d\udcc4 Beatsheet - \ud83d\udcc4 Notes for Podcast %% Zoottelkeeper: End of the autogenerated index file list  %%</p>"},{"location":"US%20Literature/Unit%202/The%20Great%20Gatsby/Journal%20Ch%201/","title":"Journal Ch 1","text":"<p>The journey of chapter 1 for me is one of intrigue and curiosity. The setting of the novel, the jazz age, immediately grabs my attention and I am drawn into the world of the wealthy and glamorous. As I read, I am struck by the descriptions of the characters and their actions, particularly the mysterious figure of Gatsby himself.</p> <p>One significant inflection point for me is when Nick Carraway, the narrator, describes Gatsby as \"the single most hopeful person I've ever met\" (pg. 10). This statement piques my curiosity and I am left wondering about Gatsby's past and what could have led him to be so hopeful. Additionally, the scene where Gatsby and Nick first meet, and Gatsby's clear discomfort and nervousness, also stood out to me as an inflection point. It is clear that Gatsby is hiding something and this moment leaves me with questions about his true identity and motivations.</p> <p>Another inflection point for me is the description of Gatsby's parties and the excess and excesses of the era. The opulence and extravagance is both captivating and overwhelming, and it paints a vivid picture of the excesses of the jazz age. It also highlights the disconnect between the wealthy and the rest of society, which I find to be a theme that will likely continue throughout the novel.</p> <p>Overall, chapter 1 leaves me with many questions about the characters and their motivations, particularly Gatsby. I am excited to continue reading and uncovering the secrets of this novel.</p> <p>In The Great Gatsby, Gatsby's mansion is described as a grand and opulent residence that is located on Long Island's West Egg. The mansion is a symbol of Gatsby's wealth and status.</p> <p>The mansion is described as having \"a cheerful red-and-white Georgian Colonial Mansion, overlooking the bay,\" with \"a lawn of springy turf, stretching far away to the pink-and-white house on the horizon.\" The house is also described as having \"a tower on one side, spanking new under a thin beard of raw ivy\" and \"a marble swimming pool, and more than forty acres of lawn and garden.\"</p> <p>The grandeur and opulence of Gatsby's mansion suggests his wealth and status. The imagery of the \"cheerful\" and \"spanking new\" mansion, with its \"springy\" lawn and \"marble swimming pool,\" evokes a sense of luxury and extravagance. The fact that the mansion is located on Long Island's West Egg, an area known for its wealthy residents, further emphasizes Gatsby's wealth and status.</p> <p>Overall, Gatsby's mansion is a powerful symbol in the novel, representing his wealth, status, and longing for the past. The imagery used to describe the mansion is vivid and evocative, creating a sense of luxury and opulence that is both alluring and a little bit overwhelming.</p>"},{"location":"US%20Literature/Unit%202/The%20Great%20Gatsby/Journal%20Ch%204/","title":"Journal Ch 4","text":"<p>Gatsby is first introduced to the reader through Nick's narration, and from the start, he is depicted as a mysterious and enigmatic figure. Throughout the chapter, we learn that Gatsby throws extravagant parties every weekend, yet no one seems to know much about him or his past. He is described as having a \"romantic readiness\" and being \"an American, a great one.\" This suggests that Gatsby is a dreamer, someone who is always striving for something better, and that he is proud of his American identity.</p> <p>Gatsby's past is shrouded in secrecy, and it is clear that he is not willing to share much about it. However, we do learn that he is from the Midwest and that he is an \"Oxford man\" which suggests that he is well-educated. He also tells Nick that he is an \"Owl-eyed man\" which suggests that he is wise and perceptive. Gatsby's primary motivation is his love for Daisy. He tells Nick that he has been in love with Daisy for five years and that he wants to be reunited with her. He is willing to do anything to win her back, including throwing these extravagant parties in the hopes that she will attend one of them. Gatsby's love for Daisy is described as \"an extraordinary thing\" and \"an ecstasy\" which suggests that his love for her is intense and all-consuming.</p> <p>In conclusion, Gatsby is a complex and mysterious character, who is driven by his love for Daisy. He is a dreamer and a romantic, who is proud of his American identity. However, there are many questions that remain unanswered about his past, which makes him an intriguing and compelling character. </p> <p>Questions that I still have about Gatsby include: * What is the true nature of his wealth? * What is his background, and how did he acquire his wealth? It doesnt seem plausible that his relatives would just all suddenly die and leave so much wealth for him.  * What is the reason behind his mysterious behavior? </p> <p>Overall, Gatsby's character is intriguing and complex, and I look forward to uncovering more about him as I continue reading the novel.</p>"},{"location":"US%20Literature/Unit%202/The%20Great%20Gatsby/Journal%20ch%205/","title":"Journal ch 5","text":"<p>Today I read Chapter 5 of The Great Gatsby and the relationship between Gatsby and Daisy escalated and changed quite a bit. The setting of the chapter played a huge role in enhancing the mood and emotions of the central scenes. The time was in the afternoon and the weather was hot and humid, which added to the tension and anticipation of the meeting between Gatsby and Daisy.</p> <p>As the chapter progressed, the relationship between Gatsby and Daisy deepened. Gatsby was nervous and excited to see Daisy again, while Daisy was more reserved and seemed to be conflicted about her feelings towards Gatsby. Despite their initial hesitation, the two eventually fell into their old patterns of flirting and the chemistry between them was palpable.</p> <p>What's great about the rising action in this chapter is the buildup of tension and anticipation. Gatsby's longing for Daisy and his desire to win her back is palpable, and the reader can feel the tension as he tries to make the perfect impression. The moment that really makes me think is when Daisy finally speaks to Gatsby after so many years and he realizes that he might not have won her back after all. This is a turning point in the story and it highlights the reality of Gatsby's situation and the difficulty he will face in trying to win Daisy back.</p> <p>Overall, I feel a mix of emotions about Gatsby, Daisy, and their deepening relationship. On one hand, I feel sympathy for Gatsby and his unrequited love for Daisy. On the other hand, I also feel a sense of disappointment towards Daisy for not being honest with herself about her feelings towards Gatsby. However, the chemistry between the two is undeniable and their love story is truly captivating.</p> <p>This chapter has been a rollercoaster of emotions and has sparked my imagination in ways I never thought possible.
