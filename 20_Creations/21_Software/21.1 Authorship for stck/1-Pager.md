Subject: Introducing AuthorVectorizer - Unleashing the Power of Authorship Attribution for STCK.ME

Dear STCK.ME Team,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to reach out and introduce you to a fascinating software tool im working on called AuthorVectorizer (currently brainstorming a better name), which I believe could add a fun and exciting feature to STCK.ME. As an organization focused on independent journalism and blog posting, AuthorVectorizer can elevate the user experience by enabling readers to guess the author of a given text.

AuthorVectorizer is a Python-based program that uses linguistic analysis techniques to predict the most likely author of a text. Fueled by my interest in [Word2Vec](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/text/word2vec) it started as a project for my computer science class but has evolved into a more powerful tool. By analyzing features such as average word length, different word ratios, hapax legomena ratio, sentence complexity, and more, AuthorVectorizer categorizes text using vectors and provides insights into the unique writing styles of various authors through basic vector math.

Here is how integrating AuthorVectorizer with STCK.ME would benefit your platform:

1. Engaging User Experience: AuthorVectorizer adds an interactive and entertaining element to the reading experience on STCK.ME. Users can process their writing and identify potential writers (on or off the site) that have similar writing styles
    
2. Promoting Independent Journalism: By showcasing the distinct writing styles of different authors, AuthorVectorizer emphasizes the diversity and individuality of independent journalists and bloggers. It can encourage readers to explore and appreciate the unique perspectives represented on STCK.ME.
    
3. Recommender System: Can be used to recommend users to other texts (written by the same author) that are similar in style or content. 
	1. ie. "if you enjoyed {A}, you might like {B}, because {...}"
    
4. Data Insights: Over time, the aggregated data from AuthorVectorizer can provide valuable insights into the preferences and patterns of STCK.ME readers. These insights can inform content curation, author collaborations, and personalized recommendations.
    

To implement AuthorVectorizer on STCK.ME would require integrating the existing Python script (or "translated" js/jsx) into the platform's backend. I can assist with the integration process (despite my limited knowledge), ensuring a seamless and secure implementation.

I would be delighted to discuss this opportunity further and provide a live demonstration of AuthorVectorizer tailored to the STCK.ME platform. Please let me know a convenient time for a call or meeting, and I will be more than happy to accommodate.

Thank you for considering the addition of AuthorVectorizer to STCK.ME. I look forward to the possibility of collaborating with you and enhancing the reader experience on your esteemed platform.

Regards,

Roshan Taneja
